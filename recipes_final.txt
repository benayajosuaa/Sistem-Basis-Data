Add apples, 1/2 cup sugar and cranberries; cover and cook until apples release their liquid, about 5 minutes. Remove lid and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until soft apples fall apart and juices thicken to a thin-syrup consistency, about 5 minutes longer. Pour onto a large-lipped cookie sheet or jellyroll pan and cool to room temperature. (Can be refrigerated in an airtight container up to 5 days.) Adjust oven rack to low position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Open puff pastry sheet on a lightly floured work surface. Roll into a rectangle, about 10 by 16 inches. Transfer to a large cookie sheet. (I suggest lining the sheet with parchment paper; this ensures the crostada doesn't stick and allows easy cleanup.) Spread cooked apples over pastry, leaving a 2-inch border. Fold up pastry borders over apples. Unfold corners and form ruffled creases to keep dough from overlapping. Brush pastry border with egg white and sprinkle with the remaining 1 Tb. sugar. Bake until pastry is golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature with optional ice cream or whipped cream.

Set aside. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and stir to form a paste; cook until fragrant, about 1 to 2 minutes. Add both sugars and water; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat. Press one pastry into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie pan. Roll out remaining pastry so it will overhang the pie by about 1/2 inch. Cut pastry into eight 1-inch strips. Place sliced apples into the bottom crust, forming a slight mound. Lay four pastry strips vertically and evenly spaced over apples, using longer strips in the center and shorter strips at the edges. Make a lattice crust: Fold the first and third strips all the way back so they're almost falling off the pie. Lay one of the unused strips perpendicularly over the second and fourth strips, then unfold the first and third strips back into their original position. Fold the second and fourth vertical strips back. Lay one of the three unused strips perpendicularly over top. Unfold the second and fourth strips back into their original position. Repeat Steps 6 and 7 to weave in the last two strips of pastry. Fold and trim excess dough at the edges as necessary, and pinch to secure. Slowly and gently pour sugar-butter mixture over lattice crust, making sure it seeps over sliced apples. Brush some onto lattice, but make sure it doesn't run off the sides. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until apples are soft, 35 to 45 minutes.

Butter a 9x13-inch pan. Roll pastry into a 24x16-inch rectangle on a lightly floured surface. Cut into six 8-inch squares. Place an apple on each pastry square with the cored opening facing upward. Cut butter into 8 pieces; place 1 piece in the opening of each apple; reserve the remaining butter for sauce. Divide brown sugar between apples, poking some inside each cored opening and the rest around the base of each apple. Sprinkle cinnamon and nutmeg over apples. Using slightly wet fingertips, bring one corner of the pastry square up to the top of the apple, then bring the opposite corner to the top and press together. Bring up the two remaining corners, and seal. Slightly pinch the dough at the sides to completely seal in the apple. Repeat with the remaining apples and place in the prepared baking dish. Combine water, white sugar, vanilla extract, and reserved butter in a large saucepan. Place over medium heat, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes. Carefully pour the sauce over the dumplings. Bake in the preheated oven for 50 to 60 minutes. Place each apple dumpling in a dessert bowl, and spoon some of the sauce over the top.

Place the sliced apples in the water to keep them from browning. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Drain water from apples, and place them into the hot skillet. Cook and stir for about 2 minutes. Add brown sugar, and cinnamon, and cook, stirring, for 2 more minutes. Stir together cornstarch and 1 tablespoon water. Pour into the skillet, and mix well. Cook for another minute, or until sauce has thickened. Remove from heat to cool slightly. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Unfold puff pastry sheets, and repair any cracks by pressing them back together. Trim each sheet into a square. Then cut each larger square into 4 smaller squares. Spoon apples onto the center of each squares. Fold over from corner to corner into a triangle shape, and press edges together to seal. Place turnovers on a baking sheet, leaving about 1 inch between them. Bake for 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until turnovers are puffed and lightly browned. Cool completely before glazing. To make the glaze, mix together the confectioners' sugar, milk and vanilla in a small bowl. Adjust the thickness by adding more sugar or milk if necessary. Drizzle glaze over the cooled turnovers.

Dip apples in boiling water for a few seconds, using a slotted spoon, then dry with paper towels to remove any wax from the peels. Set apples aside to cool completely, about 30 minutes. Insert sticks into the bottom of each cooled apple through the core for a handle. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Stir brown sugar, sweetened condensed milk, corn syrup, and butter together in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly, then reduce heat to medium. Cook until a candy thermometer reads 248 degrees F (120 degrees C), stirring constantly to prevent burning, about 25 to 30 minutes. A teaspoon of caramel dropped in a glass of cold water, should form a firm ball. Remove caramel from heat and stir in vanilla extract. Working quickly, dip each apple into the hot caramel to completely coat the apple and about 1/2 inch of the wooden handle. Sprinkle apples with any desired toppings while still hot.

Grease and flour a 9x13-inch cake pan. Beat oil and eggs in a mixing bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Add sugar and vanilla; beat well. Stir together flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Slowly add flour mixture to egg mixture; mix until combined. The batter will be very thick. Fold in apples by hand using a wooden spoon. Spread batter into the prepared pan. Bake cake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.

Spread white and whole wheat bread cubes in a single layer on a large baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until evenly toasted, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer toasted bread cubes to a large bowl. Cook sausage and onions in a large skillet over medium heat, stirring and breaking up lumps, until evenly browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Add celery, sage, rosemary, and thyme; cook and stir until flavors blend, about 2 minutes. Pour sausage mixture over bread in bowl. Mix in chopped apple, dried cranberries, parsley, and liver. Drizzle with turkey stock and melted butter; mix lightly. Allow stuffing to cool completely before loosely stuffing a turkey.

Stir apples into hot butter; sprinkle with 1/4 cup white sugar, brown sugar, and salt. Cook and stir apple mixture until apples are softened, about 5 minutes. Mix in cinnamon and water; continue cooking until apples are soft and sticky, 1 to 2 more minutes. Spread apple filling onto a plate to cool. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat or parchment paper. Form a dough piece into a ball, place on a floured work surface, and roll into a circle about 8 inches in diameter. Spoon 1/3 to 1/2 cup apple filling in the center. Fold dough over filling, leaving about 1 inch of dough on the bottom side visible below the top side. Gently press dough closed around filling, using your fingertips. Fold the overhanging bottom part of dough up over the top edge, working your way around the crust, and pinch the overhang tightly to the top part of the crust. Crimp the edge tightly closed, pinching a little bit of dough with the thumb and forefinger of one hand and using your index finger on the other hand to push a small notch into the pinched dough. Continue pinching and notching all the way around until crust is tightly crimped together. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Transfer pies onto prepared baking sheet. Whisk egg with milk in a small bowl until thoroughly combined. Brush top of each hand pie with egg mixture and sprinkle with about 1/4 teaspoon white sugar. Cut 3 small vent holes in the top of each pie. Bake in the preheated oven until pies are golden brown and filling is bubbling, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool for at least 15 minutes before serving.

                                                  Amazing Apple Butter                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Combine apples and apple juice in a stockpot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and cook at a simmer until apples are soft and mushy, 20 to 30 minutes. Spoon apples into a food mill and process into puree while discarding the cores and peels remaining in the mill. Transfer process apples to a slow cooker. Cook on High with the lid off until the moisture evaporates and the volume reduces by about half, overnight to 24 hours. Stir sugar, apple cider vinegar, cinnamon, cloves, and allspice through the apple puree. Continue cooking on High until mixture mounds on a chilled plate without any water separating from the edges, another 2 to 6 hours. Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack the apple butter into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars into the boiling water using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary to bring the water level to at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all).

Stir together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Pour in milk, eggs, and oil; stir until well blended. Mix in apples until evenly distributed. Working in small batches to prevent overcrowding, drop spoonfuls of batter into the deep fryer and fry in hot oil until golden all over, about 5 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer fritters to a paper towel-lined plate. Toss warm fritters with cinnamon sugar in a bowl until well coated.

Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir apple and onion in melted butter until tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer apple and onion mixture to a bowl. Place pork chops in the same skillet over medium heat; cook until pork chops are browned, about 5 minutes per side. Place pork chops in a 9x9-inch baking dish; season with salt and black pepper. Mix applesauce, brown sugar, mustard, and cinnamon into apple and onion mixture. Spoon over pork chops. Bake, covered, in the preheated oven until pork chops are no longer pink in the center, 30 to 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

Adjust an oven rack to the middle position. Butter two (6 to 8-ounce) ramekins and dust with white sugar. Place apple slices on a microwave-safe plate, overlapping slightly if necessary. Microwave on high until slices slightly soften, about 45 seconds. Cover the plate with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel. Mix together sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Roll puff pastry sheet to less than 1/8-inch thickness. Using a pizza cutter, cut two (3x12-inch) rectangles. Reserve remaining pieces for another use. Spread melted butter over dough; sprinkle with a generous amount of cinnamon sugar. Place apple slices along one long edge of dough, about 1/4 inch beyond the edge, overlapping slices slightly. Fold the bottom half of dough over apple slices to form a long "folder" of dough with rounded edges of apple slices exposed. Beat together egg and water in a small bowl. Brush surface of dough with egg wash. Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar. Starting at one end, roll dough to form a rose-shaped pastry. Seal roll with end of dough strip. Transfer roses to the prepared ramekins. Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar. Bake on the middle rack in the preheated oven until well browned, about 45 minutes. Use tongs to remove the ramekins to a baking sheet to cool for 5 to 10 minutes. Remove apple roses from the ramekins and finish cooling on a wire rack. Dust with confectioners' sugar before serving.

Make the apple pie: Place apple slices in a large bowl. Mix white sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice together in a separate bowl until combined; sprinkle over apples and toss until evenly coated. Remove pie shell from freezer; pour apple mixture into pie shell and dot with butter. Lay a sheet of aluminum foil lightly on top of filling, but do not seal. Bake pie in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, make the streusel topping: Mix flour, oats, brown sugar, lemon zest, and cinnamon in a medium bowl until combined. Cut in butter until mixture is crumbly. Remove pie from oven and sprinkle streusel on top. Reduce heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Reserve 1 heaped teaspoon for the mincemeat. Store the rest in a small jar for a later use. Immerse two clean, 12-ounce jars in simmering water until mincemeat is ready. Wash new, unused lids and rings in warm soapy water. Prepare mincemeat: Combine apple, sultanas, sugar, currants, raisins, and butter in a saucepan. Cook over low heat and stir gently until butter has melted. Stir in chopped almonds, orange zest, 1 teaspoon mixed spice, and cinnamon. Bring mixture to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and set mincemeat aside to cool down for 30 minutes. Stir in brandy.

Shape the beef mixture into a loaf and place on a large piece of aluminum foil. Fold the foil up and around the edges of the meatloaf, creating a makeshift loaf pan. Pour 1/2 cup water into a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot) and place the steam rack inside with the handles up. Place the meatloaf on top of the rack. Close and lock the lid; seal the vent. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 25 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build. Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Release cooker pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to the manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Transfer meatloaf, still on the rack, to a baking sheet. Broil meatloaf in the oven until browned, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, make the topping: Combine ketchup, mustard, and brown sugar in a small bowl. Brush over meatloaf and broil again until caramelized, 1 to 2 minutes.

Combine apples, 3/4 cup sugar, raisins, walnuts, and cinnamon in a large bowl for the filling. Dust a flat work surface lightly with flour. Unroll puff pastry and sprinkle lightly with flour. Roll out slightly and mark into 3 equal sections. Spoon filling into the central section then fold over the section on the left and brush with egg. Fold the right section on top, just like a letter. Make shallow diagonal cuts in the top layer of the apple strudel. Brush with egg and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar. Bake in the preheated oven until apple strudel is puffed up and golden, 25 to 30 minutes.

Cut in shortening with 2 knives or a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with a fork, until flour mixture is moistened. Do not add more water than you need: when you squeeze a handful of moistened pastry mixture, it should form a ball. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Make filling: Place apples in a saucepan. Combine sugar and cinnamon; pour over apples and toss to coat. Cook, covered, in a saucepan on low heat until soft; mash with a fork to make thick applesauce. Set aside to cool. Roll dough on a lightly floured surface to 1/8-inch thick; cut out eight 4-inch rounds with a large cookie cutter. Place 1 heaping tablespoon of applesauce in the center of each pastry round. Moisten edges with cold water, fold in half, and press the edge with a fork to seal. Repeat with remaining pastry and filling. Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lower pies carefully into the hot oil in batches. Fry until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes on each side.

Place 1/2 cup butter into a 9-inch cast iron skillet; place the skillet in the preheated oven until butter is melted. Remove the skillet and sprinkle with brown sugar; return to the oven to heat while you prepare the apples. Remove the skillet from the oven; arrange 1 refrigerated pie crust on top of brown sugar. Top pie crust with 1/2 of the sliced apples. Sprinkle 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon on top. Place second pie crust over apples; top second crust with remaining apples and sprinkle with 1/2 cup sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Top with third crust; sprinkle with 1/4 cup sugar and dot with 1 tablespoon of butter. Cut 4 slits into the top crust for steam to escape.

Bring to a boil; reduce heat, cover, and simmer until apples are slightly tender, about 5 minutes. Crush cooked apples and simmer for 5 more minutes. Transfer crushed apples to a sieve or cheesecloth. Let drip into a bowl until all liquid has drained, pressing gently to release all the juice. Measure 5 cups apple juice, adding water if necessary to have the exact amount. Stir sugar into juice; add butter to reduce foaming. Bring juice mixture to a rolling boil, stirring constantly. Stir in pectin; boil for exactly 1 minute to dissolve pectin, stirring constantly. Remove from heat. Skim off excess foam with a metal spoon. Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Ladle apple jam into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/8 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars into the boiling water using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary to bring the water level to at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process for 5 minutes. Carefully remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lids do not move up or down at all). Let stand at room temperature for 24 hours.

Trim silver skin from pork tenderloins; pat dry using paper towels. Rub 2 teaspoons vegetable oil over tenderloins, then rub with sea salt. Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large, oven-proof skillet over medium heat until it shimmers. Cook tenderloins in hot oil, rotating to brown all sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer pork to a large plate. Add remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil to any drippings in the skillet. Cook apples and onions in hot oil, stirring occasionally, until onions turn translucent, about 5 minutes; add more oil if the skillet gets dry. Season with 1 teaspoon thyme and black pepper; stir gently to combine. Remove from heat. Use a pastry brush to spread Dijon mustard evenly over tenderloins. Sprinkle with remaining 2 teaspoons thyme. Nestle tenderloins into the skillet with apple mixture. Roast, uncovered, in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of tenderloins reads at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), about 15 minutes. Remove the skillet from the oven and transfer pork to a large platter. Cover with aluminum foil and let rest. Meanwhile, pour chicken stock into a saucepan and cook over medium-high heat until reduced by half, 8 to 10 minutes. Pour into the skillet with apple mixture. Cook over medium-high heat until boiling, about 5 minutes; stir in butter until melted. Slice pork and serve over apple mixture.

Place butter in a 9x13-inch baking dish, and place in the oven to melt while the oven is preheating. Remove as soon as butter has melted, about 5 minutes. Stir together 1 cup flour, 1 cup sugar, and baking powder in a medium bowl. Mix in milk until well blended, then pour the batter into the pan over the melted butter. Do not stir. Rinse out the bowl from the batter, and dry. Place cherries into the bowl, and toss with remaining 3/4 cup sugar and 1 tablespoon flour. Distribute the cherry mixture evenly over the batter.

Cover and cook, stirring often, until cherries release their juices and come to a simmer, 10 to 15 minutes. Whisk sugar with cornstarch in a bowl until combined; pour mixture into hot cherries and juice. Stir until thoroughly combined. Bring to a simmer over low heat; cook until thickened, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool before using as pie filling.

Line an 8-inch deep cake pan with parchment paper. Place sugar, candied mixed fruit, milk, butter, cherries, citrus peel, walnuts, allspice, and baking soda in a medium-sized saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly. Stir flour and eggs into fruit mixture. Pour batter into the prepared pan. Wrap the outside of the pan with brown paper or newspaper. Bake cake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Reduce temperature to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) and continue baking cake for 1 1/2 hours. Let cake sit at room temperature for 5 minutes, then invert it onto a wired rack.

Grease a 10-inch fluted tube pan (such as Bundt) with cooking spray with flour. Pour melted butter into the bottom of the prepared pan. Sprinkle brown sugar evenly on top. Drain pineapple rings over a measuring cup; reserve juice. Cut rings in half. Alternate placing halved pineapple rings and maraschino cherries around the pan. Set aside. Combine cake mix and pudding mix in a large mixing bowl. Pour enough milk into the reserved pineapple juice to make 1 cup of liquid; add to cake and pudding mixture. Pour in vegetable oil. Mix on low speed, adding 1 egg at a time, until blended. Increase speed to medium; mix until thoroughly combined and smooth, about 2 minutes. Pour batter over pineapples and cherries in the pan.

                          Grandma's Skillet Pineapple Upside-Down Cake                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Add 2 1/2 cups of the white sugar and stir once every day for 10 days. When not stirring mixture, keep it covered with a paper towel, foil, or a loose lid. Let sit at room temperature. Don't refrigerate it or cover it airtight. A pan of water underneath the jar or bowl will keep the ants out. Day Ten: Add 1 can of chunk pineapple and its juice. Cut each chunk of pineapple in half. Stir in 1/2 cup of white sugar. Stir once everyday for 10 days. The color should change, and the mixture should foam when stirred. Day Twenty: Slice each cherry in half, and stir in. Add 2 1/2 cups of the white sugar. Stir once every day for the final 10 days. The cherries will give the juice back its pinkish color. Day Thirty: Drain fruit and reserve it and the liquid. The fruit will be used in the cake. Pour the liquid into 3 glass or ceramic pint jars. One for you to start your next cake, and two for friends. Cake must be started within 3 days after receiving the starter, or you should freeze the starter to use at a later date. Do not use plastic or metal containers to store liquid! Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9x13-inch baking pans. It's best to mix the two cakes separately. Combine 1 box of the cake mix, 1 box of the instant vanilla pudding, 2/3 cup of the vegetable oil, and 4 of the eggs. Stir, then add 1/2 of the drained reserved fruit from the starter. Stir, then add 1 cup of the golden raisins, 1 cup of the chopped nuts and 1 cup of the coconut. Stir until all ingredients are combined. The batter will be stiff.

Place ham on a rack set in a roasting pan, and carefully pour about 1/2 inch of boiling water into the pan beneath the ham. Bake the ham in the preheated oven for 2 hours, or until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat (do not touch the bone) reads at least 140 degrees F (60 degrees C.) Reduce oven heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C.) In a bowl, mix together the brown sugar, flour, dry mustard, honey, and lemon juice as needed to make a thick, smooth paste. Brush the ham generously with glaze. Skewer 1 pineapple chunk and 1 maraschino cherry per toothpick, and insert the decorated picks all over the ham. Return the ham to the oven, and roast for 15 minutes. Baste the ham, fruit and all, with glaze and juices that have collected in the bottom of the pan, return to the oven, and roast for an additional 15 minutes.

In a medium microwave safe bowl combine brown sugar and reserved pineapple juice. Mix together and microwave for about 5 minutes, until mixture is thick. Pour some of this glaze over the ham about every 15 minutes in the last hour of baking, until all is used.

Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place bottom pie crust into a 9-inch pie pan; made pricks along the bottom with a fork. Bake in the preheated oven until pie crust is lightly browned, about 8 minutes. Remove crust from oven and cool for 5 minutes. Combine cherries, sugar, cornstarch, and almond extract together in a bowl. Pour cherry mixture into the prepared pie pan; dot with butter. Cover with top crusts, crimp the edges to seal, and cut vents into the top with a sharp knife. Place the pie on a foil-covered baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. If it is browning too fast cover the pie with an aluminum foil tent. Continue baking until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly, 10 to 20 minutes. Place on a wire rack to cool, about 15 minutes.

Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat; sprinkle with sugar and pour in milk. Stir with a whisk until until the thin layer of cooked-on starch at the bottom of the pan is cleared and incorporated into the mixture, 2 or 3 minutes. Place pan over medium heat, stirring frequently, until it reaches your desired of level of doneness and creaminess, 8 to 10 minutes. The longer it cooks, the thicker and stickier it will be. Remove from heat. Add vanilla and cinnamon. Very quickly whisk in the egg yolk (to prevent it from cooking). Whisk for about 1 more minute. Add butter and dried cherries; stir thoroughly. Transfer warm pudding to serving dishes. Cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, 3 to 4 hours.

Cook the jam at a rolling boil for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and skim off any foam. Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack the cherry jam into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then carefully lower the jars into the pot using a holder. Leave a 2 inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary until the water level is at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a full boil, cover the pot, and process for 15 minutes, or the time as recommended by your county Extension agent. Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all).

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch baking dish with butter. Spread out cherries in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Combine 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup sugar and salt in a bowl. Add eggs one at a time; beat with an electric mixer after each addition until smooth and creamy. Remove vanilla bean from milk and discard. Add milk to egg mixture. Pour in heavy cream; mix until smooth. Pour mixture evenly over cherries. Bake in the preheated oven until top of clafoutis is golden, 45 to 50 minutes.

In a mixing bowl, whisk 1 cup sugar, flour, baking powder, and baking soda together until evenly combined. Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir the pitted cherries in the butter until they are tender, sprinkling them with 1 tablespoon of sugar, 8 to 10 minutes. Set aside. Form a well in the center of the dry ingredients, and pour in 1/2 cup olive oil, eggs, and yogurt; use your fingers to lightly stir the liquid ingredients into the flour mixture to make a soft dough. Scrape the batter into a 9x12-inch baking dish. Drizzle the batter with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and top with the cherries. Bake in the preheated oven until the cake is set and golden on top, about 40 minutes. A toothpick inserted into the center of the cake should come out clean.

Dough will be very thick, you will need to use your hands. Form dough into a ring shape on top of a dinner plate. Wrap in many layers of plastic wrap and/or aluminum foil. Allow to age in the refrigerator for at least a week. The flavors will have a chance to blend and all of the milk will be absorbed into the cake.

Cream the cream cheese, butter or margarine, sugar, and vanilla together until smooth. Beat in eggs one at a time. Sift together 2 1/4 cup flour, baking powder, and salt; fold into cream cheese mixture. Dredge cherries in 1/4 cup flour, and fold into batter. Sprinkle pecans over the bottom of an ungreased 10 inch angel food tube pan. Bottom should be completely covered. Add a few more pecans if necessary. Spoon batter into pan on top of nuts. Bake for about 75 minutes, or until an inserted wooden pick comes out clean. Allow cake to cool in pan. Run knife around outside edge and center tube. Ease cake out of pan, and onto plate.

Grease and lightly flour two 8- or 9-inch round cake pans or one 9x13-inch cake pan. Reserve 1/4 cup maraschino cherry juice. Coarsely chop cherries to make 1/2 cup. Set aside. Sift cake flour, baking powder, and 1/4 teaspoon salt and set aside. Beat shortening in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed for 30 seconds. Add white sugar and beat until well combined. Add egg whites, one at a time, beating well after each. Combine 2/3 cup milk and reserved 1/4 cup cherry juice. Add the flour and milk mixture alternately to the shortening mixture, beating on low speed after each addition until just combined. Stir in the chopped cherries and nuts. Pour batter into prepared pans. Bake in the preheated oven until cake springs back when lightly touched with a finger or a tester comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes for round cakes (or 30 to 35 minutes for a 9x13 inch pan). Cool cakes in pans on a wire rack for 10 minutes, then invert onto a wire rack to cool completely. To make frosting: Beat butter in a large bowl until fluffy. Gradually add 3 cups sifted confectioners' sugar; beat well. Slowly beat in 1/3 cup milk, vanilla, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Gradually beat in the remaining 3 cups sifted confectioners' sugar. Beat in additional milk (1 to 2 tablespoons) if needed, to make the frosting spreading consistency. If desired, tint the frosting pink by adding 6 drops red food coloring.

Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Roll out pie crust and lay into a 9-inch pie pan. Combine almonds, brown sugar, oats, flour, and salt in a large bowl. Work butter into the almond mixture with your fingers, breaking up any large pieces, until incorporated completely. Cover and chill for 15 minutes. Combine cherries, lemon juice, white sugar, and cornstarch. Stir until well coated and no dry lumps remain, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour cherries and any accumulated juices into the prepared pie pan. Press down into the pan. Crumble oat mixture over the top. Place the pan on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until cherries are bubbling and the crust and crumble topping are browned, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Let cool completely.

Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan. Melt butter in the microwave, about 1 minute. Stir in sugar and cocoa powder. Blend in 4 eggs, one at a time, using an electric mixer; add vanilla extract. Combine flour (see Cook's Note), baking powder, and salt in a small bowl, and add to the batter. Mix until well combined and pour into the prepared baking pan. Level with a knife or spatula. Beat together cream cheese, sugar, and 1 egg in a second bowl until smooth. Dollop the cream cheese mixture on top of the brownie batter. Separate cherries from the jelled filling and dollop them over the cream cheese mixture, saving leftover jelly for another use if desired. Swirl together using a knife. Bake in the preheated oven until brownies are set and edges pull away from the sides of the pan, 35 to 45 minutes.

Immerse in simmering water for 10 minutes to sterilize. Wash new, unused lids and rings in warm soapy water. Fill sterilized jars with cherries up to the "neck" of the jar. Pour water into a large pan and bring to a boil. Add sugar and keep boiling until sugar dissolves. Pour hot simple syrup over cherries into the jars up to 1/8-inch from the top. Run a clean knife or thin spatula around the insides of the jars to remove any air bubbles. Wipe rims with a moist paper towel to remove any spills. Top with lids and tightly screw on rings. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars 2 inches apart into the boiling water using a holder. Pour in more boiling water to cover jars by at least 1 inch. Bring to a rolling boil, cover, and process for 20 minutes. Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart. Let rest for 24 hours without moving the jars. Gently press the center of each lid with a finger to ensure the lid does not move up or down. Remove the rings for storage and store in a cool, dark area.

Season chicken with salt and pepper, then coat with flour. Fry in hot oil until browned, turning as needed. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and cook until meat is tender and juices run clear, about 25 minutes. Remove chicken from the skillet; pour off all but 1/4 cup drippings. Return the skillet to medium heat and stir in cherries, reserving some cherry liquid for later. Stir in sugar and bring to a boil. Dissolve cornstarch in reserved cherry liquid, then stir into the skillet. Cook, stirring gently, until thickened.

Line muffin cups with paper or foil liners. Remove top from each sandwich cookie; crush tops and set aside. Place creme-topped cookies in the prepared muffin cups, creme-side up. Beat cream cheese, sugar, cocoa, and vanilla in a large bowl with an electric mixer until fluffy. Mix in eggs until blended. Fill the prepared muffin cups 3/4 full; sprinkle 1/4 cup reserved cookie crumbs on top. Discard remaining crumbs or save for another use. Bake in the preheated oven until set, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool completely; cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Top each cheesecake with 2 tablespoons cherry filling and a dollop of whipped topping just before serving.

Spray two 8-inch round cake pans with vegetable oil spray. In a medium bowl, sift together flour, salt and baking powder. Set aside. In a large mixing bowl, cream butter with the sugar until fluffy. Add egg and beat well. Add flour mixture alternately with the evaporated milk. Fold in vanilla and almond extracts and 1 cup chopped figs. Divide into two prepared 8-inch round cake pans. Bake in preheated oven until cake springs back when lightly touched with a fingertip and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool cake layers on wire rack. To make the filling: In a saucepan, combine 2 cups chopped figs, brown sugar, water and lemon juice. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook until thickened, about 20 minutes.

Pour the boiling water over the figs and soak for 1 hour. Drain figs and rinse thoroughly with cold water. In a large Dutch oven combine the sugar and the 4 cups of water; bring to a boil and cook for 10 minutes. Add the figs and lemon slices to the syrup in the Dutch oven and cook for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Spoon figs into hot, sterilized jars and spoon syrup over figs, leaving 1/2 inch of head space. Top jars with lids and screw bands on tightly. Process for 10 minutes in a hot water bath.

Place the fig halves, cut side up, on a baking sheet. Top each half with about 1/2 teaspoon goat cheese. Place one almond on each, press to push the cheese slightly into each fig. Broil the figs in the preheated oven until the cheese is soft and the almonds are turning a rich shade of brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the broiler and let cool for 5 minutes.

Cook fig mixture, stirring frequently, for 4 minutes; remove from heat. Sterilize jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pour hot fig mixture into hot, sterilized jars, filling to within 1/2 inch of the top. Run a knife or thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids and screw on rings. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars into the boiling water using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary to bring the water level to at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process for 15 minutes. Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area.

Reduce heat to medium-low, cover saucepan, and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened and caramel-colored, 20 to 25 minutes. Stir figs into onion; cook and stir until figs begin to lose their shape and have softened into onion, 10 to 15 minutes. Pour balsamic vinegar into fig-onion mixture; cook until all the liquid has evaporated, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, into fig-onion mixture until desired sweetness is reached.

Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add chicken thighs and cook, 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Add figs, chicken broth, balsamic vinegar, and shallot. Bring contents to a boil, cover, reduce heat, and let simmer until chicken thighs are no longer pink in the centers and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the centers reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 8 minutes. Transfer thighs to a serving plate and keep warm. Remove figs from the skillet using a slotted spoon and place them around the chicken on the plate. Add minced rosemary to the skillet contents, increase heat to medium-high, and allow contents to come to a full boil to create a the reduction. Continue to boil, stirring often, until liquid reduces to approximately 1 cup, 8 to 10 minutes. Drizzle balsamic reduction over chicken and figs and garnish with rosemary sprigs. Serve warm.

Spray a 9-inch loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray. Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl. Set aside. Beat ricotta cheese, sugar, and butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Beat in eggs, one at a time, followed by almond extract. Beat in flour mixture on low speed, scraping down the sides of the bowl until combined; beat batter for about 30 seconds more. Place chopped figs into a bowl, sprinkle 1 tablespoon flour over, and stir to coat. Fold figs into the batter. Pour into the prepared loaf pan. Place fig slices on top of the batter, down the center. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 45 to 60 minutes. Remove from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool.

Top with another sheet of plastic wrap and use a rolling pin to flatten into a 4x8-inch rectangle. Remove the top sheet of plastic wrap and cover goat cheese with slices of prosciutto, slightly overlapping the edges. Cover prosciutto with a new sheet of plastic wrap and flip both sheets over so the goat cheese layer is now facing up. Remove top sheet of plastic wrap. Cover goat cheese evenly with figs, basil, and black pepper. Starting from the long edge, roll tightly to form a log.

Grease a 9x13 inch pan. Mix together the flour, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, 1 teaspoon baking soda, baking powder and salt. Set aside. In a large bowl, cream together 1 cup butter and 1 1/2 cup sugar until light and fluffy. Stir in the eggs. Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the buttermilk, mixing just until incorporated. Fold in the chopped figs and pecans. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool. To make the icing: In a large saucepan, mix together butter, sugar, evaporated milk and baking soda. Bring to a boil, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Then cook without stirring until the mixture turns brown, or until it reaches the soft ball stage on a candy thermometer (234 degrees F - 115 degrees C). Cool to lukewarm (110 degrees F). Pour into a small bowl and beat until it thickens to spreading consistency. Quickly spread icing onto the cooled cake.

Transfer to a 3 1/2-quart pot. Add figs, sugar, water, lime juice, and balsamic vinegar. Lightly pulse with an immersion blender until mostly smooth, with some chunks remaining for texture. Place the pot on the stove over medium-high heat. Stir continuously as it comes to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and stir periodically, until thickened, 20 to 25 minutes. Check doneness by dropping a small spoonful of jam onto a frozen plate. Let sit for 1 to 2 minutes; if jam appears to gel, it is ready. Continue cooking if jam appears thin and runny. When jam has thickened, remove from heat and allow to cool slightly, about 10 minutes. Pour jam into a clean jar with a hermetic seal.

                     Stuffed Leg of Lamb with Balsamic-Fig-Basil Sauce                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Combine the chopped prunes and currants with the creme de cassis in a small bowl, and set aside. In another small bowl, combine the rosemary, thyme, coriander, salt, and pepper; set aside. Untie and unroll the lamb, lay it out flat on the work surface. Trim off excess fat, and cut any thick parts open so that it is evenly thick and somewhat rectangular in shape. Sprinkle half of the herb mixture over the lamb. Mix the almonds and chopped mint into the prune mixture; spread evenly over the lamb. Roll up starting at one of the short sides, and tie with kitchen twine in 1-inch intervals. Cut 9 slits about 1-inch deep into the top of the lamb, and insert a slice of garlic in each. Rub with olive oil, and sprinkle with the remaining herb mixture. Place lamb seam-side up on a rack set in a roasting pan. Roast in the preheated oven to desired doneness. For medium-rare, a thermometer inserted into the center will read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Remove lamb from the oven and cover with foil. Allow to rest for 15 minutes while proceeding with the recipe. While the lamb is resting, bring the balsamic vinegar to a boil in a small saucepan over high heat. Boil until the vinegar has reduced by half, 4 to 5 minutes. Once reduced, stir in the butter, honey, and sliced figs. Stir until the butter has melted, then remove from the heat, stir in the chopped basil and set aside. To serve, remove the twine from the lamb and cut into 1/2 inch thick slices.

Heat olive oil and butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add chicken to the skillet and cook until tenders are golden brown, no longer pink in the centers, and juices run clear, 5 to 6 minutes, flipping halfway through. Transfer to a plate and cover loosely with aluminum foil to keep warm. Add shallot and garlic to the same skillet and cook until softened, about 2 minutes. Add red wine and balsamic and let simmer until reduced by half, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in figs, thyme, Dijon mustard, honey, and salt; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low or medium-low and let simmer until thickened, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in butter.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly sprinkle flour over paper. Whisk flour, oats, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Whisk oil and egg together in a separate bowl until smooth; add honey and mix well. Mix oil mixture into flour mixture just until batter is moistened. Sprinkle sugar over figs in a bowl and toss to coat; fold into batter. Transfer batter to the middle of the prepared baking sheet and form into a 7-inch circle. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Score the batter into 8 sections and continue baking until scones are cooked through and lightly browned on top, about 20 minutes more. Cut into 8 scones and slide every other scone back from the circle to allow cooling.

Bring sugar and water to a boil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring until sugar has dissolved. Stir in fig pulp, lime juice, cinnamon, ginger, and white pepper. Cook, stirring often, until a candy thermometer reads 210 degrees F (100 degrees C), about 20 minutes. While preserves are cooking, sterilize jar and lid in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack the hot preserves into the sterilized jar to within 1/4 inch of the top.

Place the baguette slices on an ungreased, foil-lined baking sheet. Bake the bread in the preheated oven until the bottoms are brown, about 5 minutes; flip and bake until crisp, 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven. Spread 1 tablespoon of ricotta on each slice of toasted bread. Place a few ribbons of basil on each, arrange a slice of fig on top, and drizzle the finished crostini with balsamic vinegar.

Heat 2 tablespoons butter and 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-low heat. Add green onion; cook and stir until softened, about 1 minute. Pour in rice and stir until coated in butter and oil and starting to toast, 2 to 3 minutes. Increase heat and pour in wine. Simmer until alcohol has evaporated and the wine is mostly absorbed. Reduce heat to medium and stir in 1 ladle of boiling broth. Continue stirring until the rice has absorbed the liquid and turned creamy. Once the liquid has been fully absorbed, add the next ladle. Repeat this process, stirring constantly until all liquid has been used or rice is tender yet firm to the bite (al dente). Stirring in the broth should take 12 to 15 minutes in all. Meanwhile, chop 10 figs. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a medium skillet and cook chopped figs until soft and coated in butter, 4 to 5 minutes. Crush figs gently with a wooden spoon while cooking. Stir in prosciutto. Add fig-prosciutto mixture to the risotto when there are about 5 minutes left to cook. Remove risotto from heat; stir in remaining 2 tablespoons butter and grated Pecorino romano cheese. Let stand for a few minutes.

Add cranberries and figs. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Add rosemary and cook until sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes more. Carefully remove rosemary sprig and discard. Remove pot from the burner and let cool, about 10 minutes. Pour sauce into a bowl and refrigerate until ready to serve.

Let stand for 1 hour. Bring to a boil and cook over medium heat, stirring often to prevent burning, until foam has disappeared and the preserves are thickened, 25 to 40 minutes. Sterilize jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack the fig preserves into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars into the boiling water using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary to bring the water level to at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process for 10 minutes. Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area, and wait at least 2 days before opening.

Spread 1 tablespoon olive oil on a baking sheet. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir shallots until translucent, about 3 minutes. Stir garlic, thyme, salt, and pepper into shallots; cook and stir until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Transfer shallot mixture to a bowl; stir in goat cheese, mozzarella cheese, cream cheese, figs, and basil until well combined. Pound each chicken breast on a work surface until thin. Spoon about 1/4 cup goat cheese mixture onto the middle of each piece of chicken. Roll chicken around the filling and wrap 2 pieces prosciutto around each chicken roll, covering the opening with 1 layer of prosciutto. Place chicken rolls onto the prepared baking sheet, seam-side down. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes; turn chicken and continue baking until chicken is no longer pink in the center and prosciutto is crisp, about 20 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Let chicken stand for 5 minutes before serving.

Reduce heat and cook at a low simmer, stirring every 20 minutes, until desired consistency, 3 to 4 hours. Inspect 5 or 6 half pint-sized jars for cracks and rings for rust, discarding any defective ones. Immerse in simmering water until fig preserves are ready. Wash new, unused lids and rings in warm soapy water. Pack fig preserves into hot, sterilized jars, filling to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a clean knife or thin spatula around the insides of the jars to remove any air bubbles. Wipe rims with a moist paper towel to remove any residue. Top with lids and screw rings on tightly. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars 2 inches apart into the boiling water using a holder. Pour in more boiling water to cover jars by at least 1 inch. Bring to a rolling boil, cover, and process for 10 minutes. Remove the jars from the stockpot and let rest, several inches apart, for 12 to 24 hours. Press the center of each lid with a finger to ensure the lid does not move up or down. Remove the rings for storage and store in a cool, dark area.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners. Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, cream of tartar, and cloves in a bowl. Blend white sugar, oil, and brown sugar together in a separate bowl using an electric mixer. Add egg and mix until creamy. Mix in buttermilk and vanilla extract. Reserve 1 tablespoon of fig mixture for frosting, and mix remainder into batter. Beat in flour mixture until just combined. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and transfer to wire racks to cool completely, about 30 minutes. Beat cream cheese and shortening together in a bowl using an electric mixer until creamy. Add powdered sugar slowly, 1 cup at a time, until creamy. Add vanilla extract. Slowly drizzle in reserved fig mixture; mix frosting until combined. Pipe frosting onto cooled cupcakes.

Line a baking sheet with foil. Place the figs and pine nuts in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until fine. Place the halved peaches onto the prepared baking sheet, cut side up. Sprinkle evenly with the white sugar. Pour the white wine over the peaches, and stuff them with the fig mixture. Pour the brandy over the peaches. Bake in the preheated oven until browned, about 15 minutes.

Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerator for 30 minutes. Blend the mixture in a blender until smooth; return to the bowl. Pour the cold water into a saucepan. Sprinkle the gelatin over the cold water; let stand 1 minutes. Place the saucepan over low heat; cook for 2 minutes. Stir the gelatin mixture into the blended watermelon mixture. Add the heavy cream; beat with an electric hand mixer at medium speed until the mixture is fluffy. Transfer the mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's directions until it reaches "soft-serve" consistency. Transfer ice cream to a one- or two-quart lidded plastic container; cover surface with plastic wrap and seal.

Remove seeds. In a heavy stockpot, combine 4 cups of prepared watermelon, sugar, and lemons. Bring to a boil over medium heat, and let the mixture boil slowly for 2 hours, stirring occasionally. The temperature of the mixture should be at 220 degrees F (105 degrees C) so the jam will set. Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack the jam into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then carefully lower the jars into the pot using a holder. Leave 2 inches of space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary until the water level is at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a full boil, cover the pot, and process for 10 minutes. Remove the jars from the stockpot and let rest, several inches apart, for 12 to 24 hours. Press the center of each lid with a finger to ensure the lid does not move up or down.

Trim the rind from the watermelon slices, and place the largest slice onto a cake plate. Alternate layering sliced strawberries, slices of cantaloupe, and slices of fresh pineapple; follow with the second-largest watermelon slice. Repeat once more to make a layered fruit stack that looks like a cake. Thinly slice a few pieces of remaining melon and pineapple. With cookie cutters or a sharp knife, cut remaining fruit slices into decorative shapes. Decorate the cake tiers with the cut fruit shapes and remaining berries. Refrigerate until serving time.

With a melon baller, scoop flesh from inside of watermelon, removing as many seeds as possible. Leave 1/2 inch of flesh inside the shell of the watermelon. Scoop cantaloupe and honeydew in the same manner, removing as much flesh as possible, and discarding the rinds. Refrigerate fruits separately until ready to assemble. In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, bring water and sugar to a boil. Remove from heat, and continue stirring until sugar has completely dissolved. Add lemon zest, and set aside to cool. To serve, place watermelon balls, cantaloupe, honeydew, oranges, pineapple, strawberries, and grapes, in a large mixing bowl. Pour syrup over, and toss thoroughly. Transfer mixture to watermelon bowl, and serve. Set aside any fruit mixture that will not fit. There will be enough fruit to refill the bowl.

The acid of the lime will mellow the flavor of the raw onion. Let stand for 10 minutes. In a large bowl, combine the watermelon cubes, feta cheese, black olives, onions with the lime juice, and mint.

Add the watermelon rinds, and return to a boil. Cook for 20 minutes, then drain the rinds in a colander. Bring the vinegar to a boil with 6 cups of sugar. Remove from the heat, stir in the watermelon rinds, cover, and let stand overnight. The following day, remove the rinds from the syrup using a slotted spoon, and place them into a clean bowl. Set the stockpot onto the stove over high heat, add 4 cups of sugar, and return the syrup to a boil. Once the sugar has dissolved, remove the stockpot from the heat, and stir in the watermelon rinds, cover, and let stand overnight. On day 3, repeat the process above, using only 2 cups of sugar: remove the rinds from the syrup using a slotted spoon, and place them into a clean bowl. Set the stockpot onto the stove over high heat, add 2 cups of sugar, and return the syrup to a boil. Once the sugar has dissolved, remove the stockpot from the heat, and stir in the watermelon rinds, cover, and let stand overnight. Repeat step 3 every day for 6 more days. On day 10, sterilize the canning jars, rings and lids in boiling water. Pack the watermelon rinds into sterilized jars, making sure there are no spaces or air pockets on the sides. Add two cloves and one cinnamon stick to each jar. Return the syrup to a boil, and fill the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Top with lids, and screw on rings. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with boiling water. Carefully lower jars into pot using a holder. Leave a 2 inch space between jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary, until tops of jars are covered by 2 inches of water. Bring water to a full boil, cover the pot, and process for 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the stockpot from the heat, and let the jars stand in the water for 2 hours off of the heat. Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all).

Add cucumber, lime juice, and sugar; blend until smooth. Pour mixture through a fine mesh strainer and using a spatula, press to remove the pulp. Don't skip this step, it's important. Pour the strained mixture into a large pitcher, add remaining 1 cup water, and stir well. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or longer. Sprinkle some Tajin® (chili lime seasoning) onto a small plate. Run the lime wedge around the top of the glass, invert the glass, and dip the rim into the seasoning.

Lightly grease and flour two 9x5-inch loaf pans. Beat together sugar, puréed cantaloupe, oil, eggs, and vanilla in a large bowl until well combined. Sift together flour, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, baking powder, and ginger in a separate bowl. Stir flour mixture into cantaloupe mixture until combined. Divide batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the centers of loaves comes out clean, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, make sauce: Combine brown sugar and butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Cook in the microwave for 3 minutes, stirring at 1-minute intervals. Mix in pecans. Pour sauce over warm loaves.

Cut in half, remove seeds, and scoop pulp into a saucepan. Place pulp over medium heat until it comes to a gentle boil. Mash the cantaloupe as it heats. This should make about 2 cups of pulp. Combine 1/2 cup sugar, flour, and salt. Add to heated cantaloupe and cook, stirring, until thick. The amount of flour seems large, but it takes considerable thickening to obtain correct consistency. In a large bowl, beat egg yolks; add water to yolks. Add a little of the cantaloupe mixture to egg yolks in order to heat yolks gradually. Stir egg yolks mixture into cantaloupe mixture. Continue cooking, stirring, until thick and creamy. Remove from heat. Add butter or margarine and flavoring to the cantaloupe mixture. Pour into baked pie shell. Beat egg whites and cream of tartar together until frothy. Continue beating, adding the 6 tablespoons sugar gradually; beat until thick peaks form. Top the pie with this meringue.

Add 2 cups cold water. Place a folded towel on blender lid and blend until liquefied, about 1 minute. Strain through a fine mesh strainer into a large bowl to remove fibers. Discard fibers left in strainer. Skim and discard excess foam from juice if desired. Place sugar and 1/2 cup water into a saucepan over medium heat and stir until water is hot and sugar has dissolved. Turn off heat and let simple syrup cool to room temperature. Stir simple syrup into watermelon juice to taste. Pour drink into a 2-quart pitcher and refrigerate until cold, at least 30 minutes. To serve, fill tall glasses with ice cubes and pour agua fresca drink over ice. Serve with straws. "So refreshing!".

Stir the mint, sugar, and lime juice together in a bowl, crushing the mint with the back of a spoon while mixing to extract flavors; pour over the fruit mixture. Seal the bowl with lid and refrigerate at least 1 hour. Just before serving, gently flip the sealed bowl several times to coat the fruit with the dressing.

Rub hens with 1 tablespoon olive oil; lightly season with salt and pepper. Stuff 1 lemon quarter and 1 rosemary sprig into each cavity. Place hens in a large, heavy roasting pan and arrange garlic cloves around them. Roast in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk wine, chicken broth, and remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil together in a small bowl. Remove hens from the oven; reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pour wine mixture over the hens and continue roasting, basting with pan juices every 10 minutes, until hens are golden brown and juices run clear, about 25 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer hens to a platter, pouring any cavity juices into the roasting pan; discard lemons and rosemary. Tent hens with aluminum foil to keep warm. Transfer pan juices and garlic cloves to a medium saucepan; boil until reduced to a sauce consistency, about 6 minutes.

Mix together flour, garlic powder, and paprika in another shallow dish or bowl. Dip chicken breasts in egg mixture, then flour mixture to coat. Heat butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken breasts and cook until golden, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Mix together broth and remaining lemon juice in a medium bowl; pour over chicken in the skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low and let simmer until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 8 minutes. Place chicken on a serving platter. Cover with lemon sauce and garnish with fresh lemon slices and parsley sprigs.

Butterfly lobster tails by cutting lengthwise through the centers of the hard top shells and meat with kitchen shears. Cut to, but not through, the bottoms of the shells. Spread tail halves apart. Place tails in the air fryer basket with lobster meat facing up. Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add lemon zest and garlic; heat until garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds. Transfer 2 tablespoons of butter mixture to a small bowl and brush onto lobster tails; discard any remaining brushed butter to avoid contamination from uncooked lobster. Season lobster with salt and pepper. Cook in the preheated air fryer until lobster meat is opaque, 5 to 7 minutes. Spoon reserved butter from the saucepan over lobster meat. Top with parsley and serve with lemon wedges.

Marinate chicken in the refrigerator for 20 minutes to 1 hour. Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove chicken thighs from marinade; shake to remove excess. Discard remaining marinade. Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 3 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Make crumble: Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk until thoroughly combined. Grate in frozen butter, stopping occasionally to toss butter into flour mixture until coated. Stir in egg yolks and vanilla with a fork until egg is mostly absorbed. Add 1 teaspoon vinegar; mix briefly. Use your hands to finish mixing, squeezing until clumps form, but mixture remains mostly dry. Add more vinegar if needed. Set crumble aside. Make filling: Combine blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries in another large bowl. Add sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, lemon zest, and cayenne pepper. Mix until well combined and sugar and cornstarch are mostly dissolved. Place about 1/2 of the crumble mixture into the bottom of a 2-quart baking dish. Press mixture down using a flat cup until well compacted. Spread berry filling on top. Sprinkle remaining crumble mixture over berries, squeezing some of the crumble into clumps. Bake in the preheated oven until top is beautifully browned and berry filling bubbles, 40 to 45 minutes. Let cool to room temperature before serving, about 30 minutes.

Pour boiling water over mixture; stir until honey is dissolved. Cover the teapot and let steep for 5 minutes. The ginger should sink to the bottom but may be strained while pouring into a mug.

Cut the rings in half so the peels are in long strips. Bring water and lemon peels to a boil in a small pan. Drain water, and repeat with fresh cold water. Repeat the boiling step three times (see Editor's Note). Drain and set peels aside. Combine 2 cups fresh water with 2 cups sugar. Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Reduce heat to low and stir in citrus peels; simmer until the white pith is translucent. Store peels in syrup, refrigerated, to keep them soft, or allow them to dry.

Stir in orzo and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered until partially cooked through but not yet soft, about 5 minutes; drain and rinse with cold water until cooled completely. Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add carrots, celery, and onion; cook and stir until vegetables begin to soften and onion becomes translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute more. Season mixture with thyme, oregano, bay leaf, salt, and black pepper; continue cooking another 30 seconds before pouring chicken broth into the pot. Bring broth to a boil. Partially cover the pot, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until vegetables are just tender, about 10 minutes. Stir orzo, lemon juice, and lemon zest into broth; add chicken. Cook until chicken and orzo are heated through, about 5 minutes. Add baby spinach; cook until spinach wilts into broth and orzo is tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Ladle soup into bowls; garnish with lemon slices and Parmesan cheese.

Combine eggs, lemon juice, and vanilla extract in a cup; mix using a fork until combined. Beat into egg mixture slowly on low speed. Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl. Add to egg mixture slowly on low speed until just combined. Do not overbeat; dough will be sticky. Cover and chill dough in the refrigerator for 30 minutes; it will still be sticky after chilling. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper. Form dough into balls using a cookie scoop or tablespoon and roll each in powdered sugar. Place onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing 2 inches apart. Lightly smash each ball down using your hand. Bake in the preheated oven until the middle of each cookie is just barely set, 11 to 12 minutes.

Sauté onion in oil until translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add chicken to onion in the skillet; cook until chicken is lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Combine ketchup, sugar, soy sauce, lemon juice, and pepper in a bowl; mix well. Pour over chicken; bring to a boil, then reduce heat. Cover and simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 25 to 35 minutes.

Move an oven rack to the lowest position. Place salmon fillet, skin-side down, in the middle of a large piece of parchment paper; season with salt and black pepper. Cut two 3-inch slits into fillet with a sharp knife. Stuff chopped basil leaves into the slits. Spray fillet with cooking spray and arrange lemon slices on top. Fold the edges of parchment paper over fillet several times to seal it into an airtight packet. Place sealed packet onto a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven on the bottom rack until salmon flakes easily and flesh is pink and opaque with an interior of slightly darker pink color, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of fillet should read at least 145 degrees F (65 degrees C). To serve, cut open the parchment paper and remove lemon slices before plating.

                                        Chicken with Lemon-Caper Sauce                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Mix together flour and salt in a medium dish or resealable plastic bag. Coat chicken in flour mixture; shake off excess. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken in hot oil until golden brown and cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer chicken to a plate; cover and keep warm. Pour white wine into the skillet; allow to boil while scraping the cooked bits from the bottom of the pan. Add lemon juice; boil until reduced by half, 2 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle cubed butter into boiling sauce. Swirl and shake the pan vigorously until butter is completely incorporated and sauce thickens. (Butter must never come to rest, or sauce will separate and become oily.) Remove from heat and stir in capers. Pour lemon-caper sauce over chicken; serve with lemon wedges.

Line a rimmed baking pan with aluminum foil. Place a rack on top of foil. Rub olive oil on both sides of chicken and generously season with salt and black pepper. Arrange lemon slices and rosemary on the rack and place chicken, skin-side up, onto the rack. Roast in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 45 to 55 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer chicken to a serving platter and tent a piece of aluminum foil over it. Discard lemon and rosemary and remove rack. Pour wine into the baking pan and gently loosen the bits of food in the pan with a wooden spoon, being careful not to tear the foil.

Line the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish with aluminum foil and coat with cooking spray. Unroll 1 crescent roll dough; press into the bottom of the prepared baking dish, stretching to the edges. Mix together lemon juice and 3/4 of the lemon zest in a large bowl. Beat cream cheese and 1/2 cup sugar into juice-zest mixture with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy; spread over crescent roll dough in the baking dish. Unroll remaining crescent roll dough and place over cream cheese mixture, stretching to the edges. Brush melted butter on top. Mix together 3 tablespoons sugar and remaining lemon zest in a small bowl; sprinkle over melted butter. Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden brown, about 30 minutes. Allow to cool for about 20 minutes. Lift dessert from the baking dish using foil; transfer to a cutting board. Cut into squares, leaving on foil.

Make the crust: Mix cookie crumbs and melted butter together in a bowl until evenly combined; press into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Make the filling: Beat cream cheese, sour cream, and sugar together in a bowl with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in lemon juice, lemon zest, and vanilla until smooth, scraping the bottom and sides of the bowl as needed. Spread mixture over crust in the springform pan. Bake in the preheated oven until almost set in the center, about 1 hour. Let cool to room temperature, about 1 hour, then refrigerate until completely cooled, at least 3 to 4 hours. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Make the meringue: Beat egg whites in a bowl with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Beat in sugar and cream of tartar until mixture is glossy and stiff peaks form. Spread lemon curd over chilled cheesecake. Mound whipped egg whites over top and spread until curd is completely covered. Bake in the preheated oven until meringue is golden brown, about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and chill, uncovered, in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or up to 1 day before serving. Don't cover the meringue or it may collapse.

Mash with the pestle into a fine paste, 4 or 5 minutes. Mix in lemon juice. Add a teaspoon of olive oil; stir and mash until oil is incorporated. Add another teaspoon and mix in thoroughly. Continue incorporating olive oil, teaspoon by teaspoon, mashing and stirring until aioli thickens up. If the aioli gets thicker than you like, add a few drops of water.

Make the scones: Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Cut in cold butter with 2 knives or a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Whisk milk, lemon juice, lemon zest, and vinegar in a small bowl; stir into flour mixture until dough is moistened. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead briefly, 5 or 6 turns. Pat or roll dough out into a 1-inch-thick round. Cut into 10 wedge-shaped pieces; arrange 1 inch apart on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until bottom edges are golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool scones on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, make the glaze: Stir confectioners' sugar, melted butter, lemon juice, and vanilla together in a bowl until smooth. Stir water into sugar mixture, 1 tablespoon at a time, to make a glaze; drizzle glaze over warm scones.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Spread banana slices out onto the prepared baking sheet, making sure slices are not touching. Brush with lemon juice. Bake in the preheated oven for 90 minutes. Check bananas, lifting slices up to separate from the paper once or twice. Continue baking until bananas are dried out, 30 to 90 minutes more.

Add sugar all at once, stirring, and bring back to a full rolling boil. Boil for 1 minute. Mix in butter to settle foam. Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack the pear jam into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw-on rings. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars into the boiling water using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary to bring the water level to at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process for 10 minutes. Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area.

Place in refrigerator until cool, about 30 minutes. Blend cucumber in a blender or food processor until mashed into a pulp. Pour cucumber pulp into a fine mesh strainer placed over a bowl; allow to sit until you have about 2/3 cup of cucumber juice in the bowl, about 15 minutes.

Line the bottom and sides of a 9-inch pie plate with one pie crust. Lightly brush crust with egg to prevent dough from becoming soggy later. Set second crust aside. Place peaches in a large bowl, sprinkle with lemon juice, and mix gently. Mix together sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt in a separate bowl. Pour over peaches and mix until combined. Pour into pie crust and dot with butter. Cover filling with remaining pie crust. Flute the edges to seal or use a fork dipped in egg to press them down. Brush remaining egg on top, then cut several slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape. Bake pie in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake until crust is brown and juice begins to bubble through the vents, 30 to 35 more minutes. If the edges brown too fast, cover them with strips of aluminum foil about halfway through baking. Cool pie for 15 minutes before slicing.

Mix self-rising flour, sugar, and milk together in a bowl until well combined and no lumps remain. Pour melted butter into a 9- or 10-inch cast iron skillet. Pour flour-milk mixture over top. Carefully pour peaches and syrup into the skillet. Use a spatula to spread peaches evenly around the pan. Bake in the preheated oven until the crust turns golden brown, 30 to 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for about 10 minutes before serving.

Work in shortening with a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Whisk together egg and cold water in a small bowl. Sprinkle over flour mixture; work with hands to form dough into a ball. Wrap with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Roll out 1/2 of the chilled dough to 1/8-inch thickness. Place in a 9x13-inch baking dish, covering the bottom and halfway up the sides. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Make filling: Mix peaches, orange juice, and lemon juice in a large saucepan. Add butter and cook over medium-low heat until butter is melted. Stir together sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a bowl; mix into peach mixture until combined. Pour into baked crust. Roll remaining dough to 1/4-inch thickness. Cut into 1/2-inch-wide strips. Weave strips into a lattice over peaches. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar, then drizzle with melted butter.

Grease the bottoms and sides of 16 muffin cups, or line with paper liners. In a large bowl, mix the flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt. In a separate bowl, mix the oil, eggs, and sugar. Stir the oil mixture into the flour mixture just until moist. Fold in the peaches. Spoon into the prepared muffin cups. Bake 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean. Cool 10 minutes before turning out onto wire racks to cool completely.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Remove plastic packaging from pie crusts and gently unroll one piece on a floured work surface. Dust the dough with flour on both sides. Fit the dough inside a 9-inch pie pan, shaping and gently stretching it to the top edge of the pie pan. Stir together frozen peach slices, sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl (see note.) Pour peach mixture into the unbaked pie crust and gently level out the top of the peaches with the back of a spoon. Peach slices will still be frozen. Gently unroll the second piece of dough on the floured work surface. Fit the second dough circle on top of the peaches, and allow an even amount to hang over the edge of the pan, all the way around. Brush the top of the pie with beaten egg, discarding any excess egg. Fold the edges of the top crust under, using the edge of the pan for a guide. Press the top crust and the bottom crust together to form a crimped edge. Lightly cover the crimped edge of the pie with strips of aluminum foil or with pie crust shields, to prevent over-browning. Cut several slits in the top crust with a sharp knife. Sprinkle sparkling sugar over the crust. Place the pie on a baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven until the pie is browned and bubbly, about 1 hour. Cool on a rack about 30 minutes and serve warm.

Peel and slice. Cut slices in half to get roughly 2 cups of sliced peaches. Bring sugar and water to a boil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Boil until a syrup forms, about 3 minutes. Stir in peaches until coated. Bring syrup back to a light simmer, about 1 minute. Immediately remove from heat and pour mixture into a bowl. Transfer peaches into a large bowl using a slotted spoon. Pour in heavy cream and stir to combine. Divide mixture between serving glasses, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until completely chilled and cream has absorbed all the peach flavor, at least 3 hours.

Immerse in simmering water until peaches are ready. Wash new, unused lids and rings in warm soapy water. At the same time, combine sugar, vinegar and water in a large pot, bring to a boil. Boil until syrupy, about 5 minutes. While the sugar mixture is boiling, press 1 to 2 cloves into each peach. Place peaches into the boiling syrup. Boil until peaches are tender, about 20 minutes. Spoon peaches into hot, sterilized jars, and top with liquid, filling to within 1/2 inch of the rim. Insert a cinnamon stick in each jar. Wipe the rims with a clean dry cloth, and seal with lids and rings. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars 2 inches apart into the boiling water using a holder. Pour in more boiling water to cover jars by at least 1 inch. Bring to a rolling boil, cover, and process for 10 minutes to seal, or consult times recommended by your local extension. Remove the jars from the stockpot and let rest, several inches apart, for 12 to 24 hours. Press the center of each lid with a finger to ensure the lid does not move up or down. Remove the rings for storage and store in a cool, dark area.

Mix peaches, 3/4 cup white sugar, brown sugar, butter, cornstarch, vanilla extract, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, and salt in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir until sugars are dissolved and butter is melted, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle each biscuit with 1 pinch cinnamon, 1 pinch white sugar, and 1 pinch nutmeg. Flatten biscuits on a lightly floured surface using a rolling pin. Cut each flattened biscuit into 12 to 15 small squares; stir into peach mixture. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 10 minutes. Pour peach-biscuit mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish and allow to thicken for 2 to 3 minutes; cover or decorate with pie crust. Cover dish with a sheet of aluminum foil and place dish on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Cool before serving.

Butter a 10 inch tube pan and coat with white sugar. In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition, then stir in the vanilla. Reserve 1/4 cup of flour for later, and sift together the remaining flour, baking powder and salt. Gradually stir into the creamed mixture. Use the reserved flour to coat the chopped peaches, then fold the floured peaches into the batter. Spread evenly into the prepared pan. Bake for 60 to 70 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean. Allow cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, before inverting onto a wire rack to cool completely.

Place a baking sheet on the rack under the middle rack to catch drips. Generously butter a 2-inch deep (2-quart) baking dish. Place peach sections into prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with lemon juice and zest. Stir butter and sugar together in a mixing bowl. Mix until creamed and resembles a sugary, buttery paste, 4 to 5 minutes. Add oats and flour; stir until flour and oats are incorporated into the butter-sugar mixture and mixture resembles coarse crumbs, 4 to 5 minutes. Pour in milk; stir until mixture is wet and creamy, like a thick spreadable batter, 3 to 4 minutes. Drop batter by spoonful on top of the peaches. Spread batter evenly over the surface of the peaches. Sprinkle 1/4 cup sugar on the batter. Spritz with water until sugar is wet and surface glistens.

Toss until evenly coated and sugar is mostly dissolved. Transfer peaches to a 9 inch foil-lined pie plate. Cover with another piece of foil and freeze immediately to prevent peaches from discoloring. Once frozen solid, remove peaches from pie plate, with foil, and transfer to a zipper locked plastic bag for later use. When ready to use, line a pie plate with prepared crust and place frozen peaches on top. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Bake in the preheated oven on the bottom rack for 20 minutes. Lower heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking for another 30 to 35 minutes, or until completely warmed through.

Place one crust in the bottom of a 9 inch pie plate. Line the shell with some sliced peaches. Sprinkle some of the butter mixture on top of the peaches, then put more peaches on top of the the crumb mixture. Continue layering until both the peaches and crumbs are gone.

Sprinkle the top with cinnamon and sugar. Empty the cake mix on top of the peaches in an even layer. Place the margarine on top of the cake mix in the center. Cover sauce pan with a lid and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Once you see steam escaping the saucepan, reduce heat to medium-low, and continue cooking for 10 minutes. Do not lift the lid during this time! Remove from heat and allow to stand with the lid on for 15 minutes before serving. The cake mix should look like dumplings.

Combine 1/2 cup sugar, cornstarch, and cinnamon in a saucepan and whisk to mix. Stir in sliced peaches (see Editor's Note) and lemon juice, tossing until peaches are evenly coated. Cook filling over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens and boils. Boil 1 minute. Pour mixture into an ungreased 2-quart casserole dish. Keep mixture hot in oven while you make the topping. In a medium bowl combine flour, 1 tablespoon sugar, baking powder, and salt. Mix thoroughly, then cut in shortening until mixture looks like fine crumbs. Add milk and stir until mixture is evenly moistened. Remove peach filling from oven and drop dough onto peaches in 6 equal-size spoonfuls. Return cobbler to oven and bake until topping is golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.

Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Chop the peaches and lightly mash them in a mixing bowl. Combine the sweetened condensed milk and the eggs; add them to the peaches and mix well. Stir in the hot water, melted butter, cinnamon, and vanilla. Stir the French bread into to the custard mixture until the bread is completely moistened. Turn the pudding into the prepared baking dish. Bake until a knife inserted in the center of the pudding comes out clean, about 1 hour and 10 minutes. While the pudding is baking, combine the brown sugar, 1/2 cup butter, corn syrup, and rum in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes or until just slightly thickened. Let cool slightly. Remove the pudding from the oven and let it cool for about ten minutes before serving. Serve warm with the caramel sauce. Cool and cover any leftover pudding and store it in the refrigerator.

Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Pour the brown sugar mixture into a 9x13 inch baking dish, and tilt the dish to cover the entire bottom. Place peaches in a layer over the sugar coating, then top with slices of French bread. In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and vanilla. Slowly pour over the bread slices to coat evenly. Sprinkle cinnamon over the top. Cover and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight. Remove the dish from the refrigerator about 30 minutes before baking to come to room temperature.

Wrap the pickling spice in a cheesecloth bag, and place in the pot. Bring to a boil, and cook over medium heat uncovered until the mixture reaches your desired consistency. It will take about 1 1/2 hours to get a good thick sauce. Stir frequently to prevent scorching on the bottom. Remove the spice bag, and ladle into hot sterilized jars. Wipe the rims with a clean moist cloth. Seal with lids and rings, and process in a barely simmering water bath for 10 minutes, or the time recommended by your local extension for your area. The water should cover the jars completely.

Set aside. Combine nutmeg, ginger, and 2 tablespoons sugar in a small bowl. Peel, quarter, and core 4 pears. Slice each quarter into 3 slices, from core end to bottom, and place in a large bowl. Cut remaining pear in half; peel, and core one half and add to the bowl. Peel, core, and slice the other half as directed above and add to the bowl. Drizzle pears with bourbon and sprinkle with spice-sugar mix, tossing to evenly coat. Melt butter in a 9-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Add 2/3 cup white sugar and salt to the melted butter, stirring to combine until mixture bubbles, 2 to 3 minutes. Place the single pear half in the center of the skillet. Fan remaining pear slices around the center, core end to the outside of the skillet and stem end toward the center. If possible, turn the pieces in the same direction. Keep adding pear slices, filling in any gaps, until they are all in the skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cook, undisturbed, until pears are fork-tender and color develops to the liquid, about 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place a baking sheet on a rack in the lower third of the oven. Remove skillet from heat and place unbaked pie shell on top of the fruit, using a fork to tuck the edges of the pie shell toward the bottom of the skillet. Place skillet on the prepared baking sheet in the preheated oven. Reduce temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake until crust is brown, 28 to 30 minutes. Remove from oven. Place a heat-safe plate, larger than the skillet, upside down over the crust. Use oven mitts to grab the plate and skillet together and quickly flip the skillet contents onto the plate; this move is tricky and requires some forearm strength and dexterity. After the flip, if the contents are not centered on the plate, use a spatula to gently move to the center. Add any fruit that remained in the skillet, and drizzle any remaining liquid over the top of the tarte tatin. Allow to sit 15-20 minutes, then serve warm.

Roll out the pastry and transfer it to a 9-inch pie plate. Trim any extra dough and crimp the edge. Combine 1/2 cup sugar, sour cream, 1/4 cup flour, egg, vanilla, and salt in a bowl until blended. Fold in the pears. Pour the mixture into the pie plate and bake the pie for 15 minutes. While the pie is baking, prepare the topping: mix the 2/3 cup flour, 1/3 cup sugar, melted butter, and rolled oats together in a bowl. Remove the pie from the oven and sprinkle with the crumble topping. Return the pie to the oven and bake until the filling is set and the crust is brown, about 20 minutes more.

Roll pastry out to 1/4 inch thickness and use it to line a 9-inch tart dish. Prick the pastry with a fork and then place into the freezer for 20 minutes to prevent pastry from rising during baking. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Set crust aside. Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Heat a saucepan about 1/3-full of water to a low simmer, about 5 minutes, then reduce heat to lowest setting. Place a heat-proof bowl over the pan in such a way that it does not touch the water. Add chocolate to the bowl and allow to melt. Limit stirring to an absolute minimum to prevent chocolate from separating. Mix ground almonds, eggs, sugar, and butter together in a bowl. Add warm melted chocolate and stir to combine. Pour chocolate mixture into the baked pastry crust. Arrange pears on top of the tart by pressing them into the chocolate mixture.

Press the pie pastry into the bottom and up the sides of a 9 inch pie plate. Flute the edges. Place the pear halves cut side down in the pie crust with the small ends toward the center. In a medium bowl, mix the butter and sugar together until smooth, then beat in the eggs one at a time until light and fluffy. Stir in flour and vanilla. Pour over the top of the pears. Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, until pears are soft and custard is set in the center. Cool completely before slicing and serving.

(This can also be done in a food processor: pulse the cold butter into the flour until the mixture resembles cornmeal; add the cream cheese and pulse until it's the size of small peas.) When you squeeze a handful of the mixture, it should form a ball. Shape the dough into a round disk, wrap it in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Toss the sliced apples and pear with the orange juice. Whisk together the brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, and cornstarch. Toss the fruit with the sugar-spice mixture and set aside. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Set out an 8-inch tart pan, or, if you'll be making a free-form tart (galette), lightly grease a baking sheet. Roll the pastry out on a lightly floured work surface to form a 10-inch circle. Transfer the dough to the tart pan or baking sheet. Arrange the fruit decoratively in the tart pastry. If you're baking the tart on a baking sheet, leave a 2-inch rim of dough and fold it up over the edge of the fruit (the pastry folds will overlap). Bake the tart in the preheated oven until the crust is browned and the filling is bubbly, about 30 minutes. Remove the tart from the oven and brush it with the apricot jam.

Fit puff pastry into a 10-inch square tart pan with removable sides. Place a pear half, cut-side down, onto a work surface. Place a chopstick above and below the pear half, so the pear is framed on the top and bottom. Thinly slice the pear half lengthwise, stopping when the knife hits the chopstick and leaving the bottom 1/4 inch of the pear intact. Repeat with the remaining pear halves. Place hasselbacked pears in a bowl; add white sugar and lemon juice and gently toss to coat. Let hasselbacked pears stand for 5 minutes. Mix cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla extract together in a bowl; spread over puff pastry. Arrange hasselbacked pears over cream cheese layer, cutting some of the halves into quarters if needed to fit them in. Slightly fan out each pear and drizzle any accumulated juices from the pear bowl over pears. Sprinkle turbinado sugar over tart.

Coat a 9-inch fluted tart pan with a removable bottom with cooking spray. Beat sugar and butter together in a small bowl until crumbly. Beat in flour and almonds. Press over the bottom and up the sides of the prepared tart pan. Beat cream cheese in another small bowl until smooth. Beat in sugar, egg, and vanilla extract. Spread over the crust. Arrange pear slices over the cream cheese layer. Combine sugar, cardamom, and cinnamon in a small bowl. Sprinkle over the pears. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking until filling is set and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 160 degrees F (71 degrees C), 15 to 20 minutes. Cool tart on a wire rack for 1 hour. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours before slicing.

Roll puff pastry out on a lightly floured surface to 1/4-inch thickness; place in the refrigerator. Melt butter in a 9-inch cast iron skillet over medium heat; stir in brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg and cook and stir until sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes. Stir maple syrup into brown sugar mixture; cook, stirring, until mixture begins to bubble. Remove skillet from heat. Place one pear half, cut side up, into the center of skillet. Cut remaining pear halves in half again; arrange pear quarters around the center pear, cut sides up. Place skillet over medium-low heat; cook pears, basting with syrup mixture, until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Remove skillet from heat. Remove puff pastry from refrigerator; place pastry over pears, tucking edges of pastry around pears inside skillet. Bake in the preheated oven until pastry is puffed and golden, about 20 minutes; allow to cool for 5 minutes. Place a serving plate over skillet; invert to remove tart (skillet will still be hot).

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Stir apple, pear, brown sugar, vanilla extract, cornstarch, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and salt together in a bowl. Whisk egg and water together in a small bowl. Roll pastry out on a lightly floured surface; cut into circles with a 3- to 4-inch round cookie cutter. Spoon a small amount of apple mixture onto center of each pastry circle; fold circles in half and press firmly to seal edges. Crimp with a fork, if desired. Place pies on prepared baking sheet. Cut 3 small slits in top of each hand pie with a sharp knife. Brush surface of pies with egg mixture; sprinkle with decorating sugar. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, about 25 minutes; allow pies to cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes. Melt chocolate chips in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 2 minutes. Drizzle melted chocolate over pies.

Add the cold butter and pulse ten times until the butter is the size of large peas. Add 3 tablespoons of cold water and pulse until it comes together. Turn onto a lightly floured work surface and bring the dough together, forming a disk. Wrap in Reynolds® Parchment Paper and refrigerate for at least 45 minutes. On a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough to 1/8-inch thickness. Fill a 9-inch tart mold or rectangle tart mold with the dough. Cut off excess from the top and refrigerate for another 15 minutes. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Cover the top of the dough with Reynolds Wrap® Aluminum Foil and weigh down with pie weights or dry beans. Bake for 15 minutes. Remove the foil and pie weights and let cool. Combine the hazelnuts and sugar in the food processor. Pulse to a fine powder. Add the butter, egg, flour, vanilla, rum and salt. Process until it comes together as a paste. Spread the mixture over the partially baked tart. On the top, arrange the pear slices in a pattern. Bake the tart for 30 to 35 minutes until golden brown.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Combine butter and 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar in a large bowl; beat using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Mix in almond flour. Add eggs 1 at a time and mix until well combined. Line a tart pan with the puff pastry and prick with a fork all over. Place chocolate in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until melted, about 5 minutes. Cool slightly. Cover puff pastry with melted chocolate. Carefully pour egg mixture on top of the chocolate on the puff pastry without mixing the 2 layers. Arrange pear slices on top of the tart. Bake in the preheated oven until pastry has puffed up and is golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.

Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Add pears; reduce heat and simmer until pears are translucent or easily pierced with a knife, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature. Combine 1 1/2 cup flour, confectioners' sugar, and salt in a bowl. Cut in 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon butter until mixture is crumbly. Mix in egg yolk until dough sticks together in large clumps. Grease a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom. Press dough evenly into the pan. Freeze for 30 minutes. Reserve leftover dough for patching cracks. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease the shiny side of a piece of aluminum foil with butter; place butter-side down over the pastry. Transfer tart pan to a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven, using leftover dough to patch any cracks, until dough looks dry and light brown, about 20 minutes. Peel off aluminum foil; let pastry cool. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine 2/3 cup white sugar and 1/3 cup butter in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Mix in ground almonds. Add egg, egg yolk, 2 teaspoons flour, and cornstarch; beat until frangipane is smooth. Beat in almond extract and vanilla extract. Spread frangipane evenly over the pastry. Drain pear halves and dry with paper towels. Cut lengthwise into even slices. Place 1 pear half on a spatula and gently fan out slices. Place on frangipane. Repeat with remaining pear halves. Bake in the preheated oven until frangipane is firm to the touch, 40 to 45 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.

Line a 9-inch pie plate with pastry. Whisk sugar, flour, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a small bowl; sprinkle 1/4 cup of sugar mixture over pastry in pie plate. Stir apples, peaches, pears, plums, and ginger together in a bowl; sprinkle with lemon juice and stir to distribute. Place fruit mixture in pie plate; sprinkle with remaining sugar mixture. Cover with pastry, pinch to seal top and bottom crusts together, and cut a few slits in top pastry with a sharp knife. Alternatively, cover with a lattice crust. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes; reduce temperature to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) and continue baking until crust is golden and filling has thickened, about 35 minutes. Cool completely before serving.

Stir grated Cheddar cheese into the flour mixture using a fork. Stir in butter using a wide spoon until mixture becomes crumbly. Set topping mixture aside at room temperature. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place pie crusts in their tins onto a baking sheet to catch drips; place crusts 1 inch apart. Sift sugar, cornstarch, and salt into a small bowl. Place pears in a large mixing bowl. When oven is hot, sprinkle sugar mixture over pears and stir to combine. Pour filling evenly into the 2 pie crusts. Divide topping mixture in half and add to the top of each pie in 4 to 6 dollops; use a wide knife to spread evenly. Bake on the middle rack of the preheated oven for about 18 minutes; the pears will produce a lot of liquid and will bubble over. Check pies and cover with aluminum foil if crust or topping is getting dark. Bake about 7 minutes more.

Using a box grater, grate the cold butter atop the flour mixture. Working quickly and using your hands, break the butter bits into the flour until they're evenly distributed and resemble the size of small peas. Add 4 tablespoons of water and mix. The mixture will be shaggy at this point. From here, add 1 tablespoon of water at a time until the dough comes together (generally about 3 additional tablespoons). Flour a work surface and dump the dough onto it. Knead a few times until it comes together. Form dough into a disk. Wrap the disk in plastic wrap and transfer to the refrigerator to chill for at least 1 hour, ideally overnight. Just before the dough is ready to remove from the fridge, mix together the filling. In a medium bowl, toss together the pear slices, brown sugar, cocoa powder, coffee grounds, vanilla extract and salt. Remove the disk of dough from the refrigerator and allow to come to room temperature for 10 minutes. Liberally flour a work surface and rolling pin. Begin to roll the dough to a 16-inch round, being sure to rotate it every so often to avoid sticking, Using the bottom of a bowl or plate that measures about 6 inches in diameter, cut out 3 circles. Re-roll the scraps to get 1 additional circle. Arrange the pears slices neatly in a circular pattern in the center of each of the pie crust rounds, leaving about 1 1/2 inch clear at the edges. Fold over the edges to cover about 1/2 inch of the filling. Repeat with the remaining rounds. Transfer the galettes to a baking sheet lined with Reynolds® Parchment Paper and place in the freezer to chill for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 400 degrees F. Lastly, brush the pie crust edges with the egg wash and sprinkle with turbinado sugar. Transfer to the oven to bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the edges are golden brown. Check on the galettes periodically. If at any time the crusts' edges are getting too brown, take a piece of Reynolds Wrap® Aluminum Foil and tent over the edges. When the edges are golden brown, remove from the oven. Serve warm with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of your favorite vanilla ice cream.

Immerse in simmering water for 10 minutes. Wash new, unused lids and rings in warm, soapy water. Meanwhile, combine pears, water, and lemon juice in a large saucepan. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in pectin, and bring to a full boil. Stir in white sugar; boil and stir until sugar is dissolved, about 1 minute. Remove from heat; stir in brown sugar, allspice, and nutmeg. Pack pear preserves into hot, sterilized jars, filling to within 1/2 inch of the top. Run a clean knife or thin spatula around the insides of the jars to remove any air bubbles. Wipe rims with a moist paper towel to remove any residue. Top with lids and screw rings on tightly. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars 2 inches apart into the boiling water using a holder. Pour in more boiling water to cover jars by at least 1 inch. Bring to a rolling boil, cover, and process for 10 minutes. Remove the jars from the stockpot and let rest, several inches apart, for 12 to 24 hours. Press the center of each lid with a finger to ensure the lid does not move up or down. Remove the rings for storage and store in a cool, dark area.

Cook, stirring gently, until sugar has melted and pecans are caramelized, 5 to 7 minutes. Carefully transfer nuts onto a sheet of waxed paper to cool. While the nuts are cooling, make the dressing: Whisk oil, vinegar, sugar, mustard, garlic, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Make the salad: Layer lettuce, pears, Roquefort cheese, avocado, and green onions in a large serving bowl. Pour dressing over top. Break cooled pecans into pieces and sprinkle over salad.

Wash lids and rings in warm soapy water. Slice ends off each prickly pear. Make 1 long vertical slit down each one. Use the slit to hold the skin and peel off. Discard peel. Place peeled pears in a blender; puree in batches until liquefied. Press puree through a fine-mesh sieve set over a bowl. Discard pulp and seeds. Measure out 3 cups prickly pear juice, lemon juice, and pectin into a large pot. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Add sugar and return to a boil, stirring constantly. Let cook, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Pour prickly pear mixture into hot jars, filling to within 1/4 inch of the top. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids and screw on rings. Place a rack in the bottom of a stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars 2 inches apart into the boiling water using a holder. Pour in more boiling water if necessary to bring the water level to at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the stockpot, and process for 15 minutes.

Stir in sugar, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir frequently to prevent scorching. When the pears are at a full boil, reduce heat to medium, and cook until the mixture is the color and texture of honey. The longer you cook it, the thicker it gets. Cooking time is usually 2 to 3 hours. Ladle into hot sterile jars, filling to within 1/4 inch of the top. Wipe rims with a clean damp cloth, and seal jars with lids and rings.

                                Curried Butternut Squash and Pear Soup                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Cut squash in half lengthwise; discard seeds and membrane. Place squash halves, cut sides down, on the prepared baking sheet. Roast in preheated oven until very soft, about 45 minutes. Scoop the pulp from the peel, and reserve. Melt butter in a large soup pot over medium heat. Stir in the onion, garlic, ginger, curry powder, and salt. Cook and stir until the onion is soft, about 10 minutes. Pour the chicken broth into the pot, and bring to a boil. Stir in the pears and the reserved squash, and simmer until the pears are very soft, about 30 minutes. Pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender. Puree in batches until smooth. Return the soup to the pot, stir in the half and half, and reheat.

Cook until the pears are soft, about 30 minutes. Press pears through a sieve or food mill, and measure out 2 quarts of the pulp. Pour the pear pulp and sugar into a large saucepan and stir to dissolve sugar. Stir in the orange zest, nutmeg and orange juice. Cook over medium heat until the mixture is thick enough to mound in a spoon. When the mixture begins to thicken, stir frequently to prevent scorching on the bottom. This will take about 1 hour. Ladle the pear butter into hot sterile jars, leaving 1/4 inch of headspace. Remove air bubbles by sliding a metal spatula around where the pear butter touches the glass. Wipe jar rims clean, and seal with lids and rings. Process for 10 minutes in a boiling water bath. The water should cover the jars by 1 inch.

Heat a skillet over medium heat. Place bread slices butter-side down into hot skillet. Arrange Brie cheese slices on top of each piece of bread. Sprinkle thyme and cracked black pepper over the top. Spread pear slices in a single layer over the Brie cheese on one slice of bread and top with a pinch of salt. Flip the slice of bread without pears onto the slice of bread with the pear slices. Continue cooking sandwich until cheese and pear are heated through and cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate and cut into halves.

Drain and cool. When pears are cool, peel, core, and coarsely chop. Place pears, onions, green bell peppers, and jalapeno peppers into a food processor, working in batches if necessary, and chop the pears and vegetables finely. Transfer pears and vegetables, including any juice, to a large pot. Stir vinegar, sugar, prepared mustard, and salt into the pear mixture and bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until flavors have blended and relish is thickened, about 1 hour. Sterilize jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack pear relish into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids and screw on rings. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then carefully lower the jars into the pot using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary until the water level is at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a full boil, cover the pot, and process for about 20 minutes or the amount of time recommended for your area. Remove the jars from the stockpot and cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all).

Reduce the heat to simmer, and stir in cranberries, pureed orange, apple, pear, dried fruit, pecans, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Cover, and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the cranberries burst. Remove from heat, and let cool to room temperature.

Add the red onion, pear, pecans, and blue cheese, and toss to mix evenly. To make the dressing, place the maple syrup, vinegar, mayonnaise, brown sugar, salt, and pepper in a blender, and blend thoroughly. With the motor running, slowly pour in the walnut oil.

Pour the mixture into the container of a blender, and add the pear halves and cream cheese. Cover and blend until smooth. Pour back into the bowl, and gently whisk in the whipped topping. Transfer to a mold or serving bowl, cover and refrigerate until firm, at least 4 hours. To unmold, dip the mold briefly into hot tap water to loosen the gelatin, then invert onto a plate.

In a large serving bowl, toss together the romaine lettuce, shredded Swiss cheese, cashews, dried cranberries, apple, and pear. Pour dressing over salad just before serving, and toss to coat.

Place the pizza crust on a pizza pan. Bake in the preheated oven until just crisp, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, combine the garlic, Dijon mustard, rosemary, and vinegar in a food processor or blender. Turn on, and drizzle in the olive oil slowly until the dressing has thickened. Quickly pulse in 1/4 cup of blue cheese; season to taste with salt and pepper. Spread the vinaigrette over the pizza crust. Sprinkle 1/4 cup of blue cheese evenly over the crust, followed by the mozzarella cheese. Arrange the sliced pears over the cheese, and sprinkle with the toasted walnuts. Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese has melted and is bubbly, 7 to 10 minutes.

Stir in zest and juice of 1 lemon. Place pears in pot. Split the vanilla bean lengthwise and scrape out the seeds. Add the seeds and split pods to the poaching liquid. Pour in sugar. Bring pot to a simmer over medium-high heat; stir gently to dissolve sugar with minimal jostling of the pears. Reduce heat so pears continue cooking over a steady, gentle simmer. Pears need to stay submerged, so place a small plate over them in the pot to keep them under the liquid. Simmer until pears are just tender, 20 to 25 minutes. (Remove plate to test the pears for doneness.) Remove pot from heat and let pears cool to room temperature in the poaching liquid. Transfer pears and vanilla beans to a storage container and cover with some of the poaching liquid. Cover and refrigerate until pears are thoroughly chilled, several hours or overnight. Reserve all of the poaching liquid (see footnote). Heat hot fudge sauce in a saucepan over medium heat until warm. Dip base of pear into the chocolate and spoon chocolate along the sides except for the top inch or so of the pear. Place dipped pears in individual serving bowls with another generous spoonful of syrup and a small scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Cover a baking sheet with a layer of plastic wrap or parchment paper. In the container of a blender, combine the sugar, lemon juice, apple and pear. Cover and puree until smooth. Spread evenly on the prepared pan. Place the pan on the top rack of the oven. Bake for 5 to 6 hours, leaving the door to the oven partway open. Fruit is dry when the surface is no longer tacky and you can tear it like leather.

Add water, apple juice, soy sauce, apricot preserves, brown sugar, garlic powder, and dry mustard. Bring to a simmer, stirring frequently to dissolve brown sugar. Reduce heat, and continue simmering for 40 minutes, or until fruit is completely soft. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Blend sauce in a food processor or blender until completely smooth, adjusting consistency with additional water, if desired. Cover, and refrigerate until ready to use.

Let each family member take a turn stirring and make a wish. If you have used more dry fruit than fresh, add a little extra ale to make the mixture less stiff. Grease 2 large or 4 small pudding basins. Fill with pudding mixture about 7/8 full. Cover tightly with greased waxed paper, then foil; secure with string. Stand pudding on a trivet in a large pot of boiling water that reaches halfway up the sides of the pudding basin. Steam puddings over medium-low heat in boiling water 10 hours for large puddings, 5 hours for small puddings, topping off water regularly until quite firm and set. If not serving immediately, let cool completely, then replace covers with fresh waxed paper and foil and store in a cool, dry place, basting from time to time with rum or brandy, for up to 3 months.

Spray a 9x5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray, or line with parchment paper. Sprinkle chopped plums with 1 tablespoon of flour in a bowl, and toss to coat. Set aside. In a large bowl, beat the margarine, white sugar, and vanilla extract with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs. In another bowl, sift together 1 1/2 cup of flour with salt and baking soda. Stir the dry ingredients into the egg mixture, alternating with yogurt until the mixture forms a smooth batter. Lightly stir in the flour-coated plums, and pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Sprinkle the top of the batter with brown sugar. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes.

Grease a 10-inch springform pan. Combine sugar and butter in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Add eggs, 1 at a time, and beat well after each addition. Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl and sift on top of the butter mixture. Mix to combine. Transfer batter into the prepared springform pan and smooth out. Set plums inside batter, cut-side up, and sprinkle evenly with cinnamon sugar. Bake in preheated oven on the lowest rack until a skewer comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes. Serve warm or cool to room temperature.

Pour half the sugar over the plums, then half the vodka over the sugar. Sprinkle on half the vanilla extract, and place about half the orange peel pieces into the jar. Layer the rest of the plums into the jar, pressing them down, and top them with the remaining sugar, vodka, vanilla extract, and orange peel pieces. Screw on the jar lid. Using an unscented candle, drip a coating of wax around the jar lid to prevent leaking. Cover the jar with a dark-colored towel. Place the jar on its side in a dark, cool place, and turn the jar every day for 21 days, replacing the towel to keep out light. After 21 days, strain out the liqueur from the plums and peel with a fine strainer lined with cheesecloth, and bottle the liqueur in attractive bottles with tight-fitting caps.

To Make Crust: In a large bowl combine 3 cups flour, 3/4 cups white sugar, baking powder, and 1/8 teaspoon salt. Mix thoroughly, then cut in 2/3 cup butter or margarine with a pastry blender, until pieces are the size of small peas. Stir in eggs, vanilla extract, milk and lemon zest. Mix just until all ingredients are combined. Allow dough to rest in refrigerator. To Make Streusel Topping: In a medium bowl mix 1/2 cup flour, brown sugar, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon salt, chopped nuts, and grated lemon zest. Work in butter or margarine with fingers until all ingredients are well combined. Set aside. To Make Fruit Filling: Place pitted and sliced fruit in a large bowl. In a small bowl, mix remaining sugar, flour, cinnamon, and nutmeg until thoroughly combined. Pour over fruit and stir gently until all fruit is evenly coated. Roll out pie crust and place in a 9 inch pie pan. Trim and flute edges, then pour in fruit filling. Evenly cover fruit with streusel topping and bake in preheated oven for 45 to 55 minutes. Serve warm, or at room temperature.

Grease and flour one 9-inch tube pan. Separate the eggs. In a small bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form, and set aside. In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar. Beat in the egg yolks and the lemon zest. Stir together the flour and baking powder and then blend the flour mixture into the creamed mixture. Gently fold in the egg whites. Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan. There will only be a little over an inch of batter. Arrange the plums, skin side down, attractively over the batter. Bake in preheated oven until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack and allow to cool before serving.

Generously season pork tenderloin with salt and black pepper. Heat oil in a large, oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat. Cook tenderloin until browned on all sides, 2 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer tenderloin to a plate. Saute onion with a pinch of salt in the same skillet until just softening, 3 to 5 minutes. Add shallots, reduce heat to medium, and cook and stir until shallots and onion are golden brown and caramelized, about 10 minutes. Stir thyme into onion mixture; place tenderloin over onion mixture, and set plum quarters, skin-side down, around pork tenderloin. Transfer skillet to preheated oven. Cook until pork is slightly pink in the center, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Transfer pork and plums to a plate. Place skillet over medium-high heat and pour water and balsamic vinegar into onion mixture. Bring mixture to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook and stir until liquid is reduced by half, 5 to 10 minutes; remove from heat.

Butter a 10 inch pie plate, and sprinkle 1 tablespoon of sugar over the bottom. Arrange the plum halves, cut side down, so that they cover the entire bottom of the pie plate. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of sugar over the top of the plums. In a blender, combine the remaining 3 tablespoons of sugar, eggs, milk, flour, lemon zest, cinnamon, vanilla, and salt. Process until smooth, about 2 minutes. Pour over the fruit in the pan. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes in the preheated oven, or until firm and lightly browned. Let stand 5 minutes before slicing. Dust with confectioners' sugar before serving.

Remove stockpot from heat and cool for 2 hours. Return stockpot to stovetop over low heat; cook gently for 2 to 3 hours. Remove from heat and keep at room temperature, 8 hours to overnight. Cook plums over low heat, stirring occasionally, about 2 hours. Remove from heat and let stand at room temperature for 2 hours. Bring plums to a boil; add sugar, lower heat, and simmer until thickened, about 15 minutes. Sterilize jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack plum butter into hot jars, filling to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a clean knife or thin spatula around the insides of the jars to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids and screw on rings. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars into the boiling water using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary to bring the water level to at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process for 15 minutes. Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area.

Grease a 9 inch cake pan. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside. In the prepared pan, combine 3 tablespoons margarine and brown sugar. Place pan inside the preheated oven until the margarine melts and begins to bubble. Set aside. In a large bowl, cream together the 1/3 cup margarine and 1 cup white sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg, then stir in the vanilla. Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the milk, mixing just until incorporated.

Season pork chops with salt and pepper; cook in hot oil until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Remove pork chops to a plate. Reduce the heat to medium; cook and stir garlic in the skillet just until fragrant, 10 to 20 seconds. Pour in soy sauce, red wine vinegar, brown sugar, ginger, and cloves; bring to a boil. Stir the mixture until the brown sugar dissolves; add plums. Cover the skillet, reduce the heat, and simmer the mixture until the sauce has thickened and plums are very soft, about 45 minutes. Mash plums with a potato masher to an applesauce-like texture. Place pork chops back into the pan and cook in the sauce until no longer pink in the middle, 10 to 15 minutes.

Combine the puree in a saucepan with the sugar and heat until the sugar dissolves. Add the lemon juice and vanilla. Beat the egg whites until frothy, add the cream of tarter, and beat until stiff. Fold the prune puree into the egg whites. Pour into a buttered and sugared 2 quart baking dish and bake in a preheated 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) oven until nicely browned. Refrigerate and serve chilled with whipping cream.

Place 1 piece of puff pastry on a baking sheet lined with a silicone mat or parchment paper. Lightly moisten one of the short edges with water. Connect the end of other puff pastry to the moistened edge. Press pieces together to form a long rectangle, trimming off loose ends with a dough scraper as needed. Cut third puff pastry piece lengthwise into 1-inch strips. Moisten the outer edges of the long rectangle with your finger; stick pastry strips on top. Poke shallow holes all over bottom of dough using a fork. Do not prick the raised border. Bake pastry shell in the preheated oven until it starts to turn golden brown, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven. Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Readjust the borders and push the bottom down with the flat side of a fork. Let cool completely while preparing filling. Place butter and 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar in a bowl; smear together using a spatula until combined. Whisk in egg until mixture is creamy. Add almond flour, salt, vanilla extract, and almond extract. Mix thoroughly. Cut each pluot into 6 wedges. Fill pastry shell with almond paste. Stick pluots snugly, but not too deeply, into filling. Bake in the preheated oven until browned and almond filling is set, 30 to 40 minutes. Transfer tart onto a wire rack and let cool completely, at least 40 minutes. Combine apricot jam and water in a microwave-safe bowl. Bring to a boil in the microwave. Let cool until warm. Brush glaze over cooled tart.

Place about 1/3 teaspoon of sugar in the hollow of each plum; close the plum, and place in a bowl. Set aside. Place potatoes in a large pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until tender. Drain. When cool enough to handle, mash potatoes with a fork or potato masher. You will need 1 cup of mashed potatoes. Set aside, and keep warm. To make the dough, sift the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together into a pile on a breadboard. Make a well in the center; add 1 cup mashed potatoes, egg yolks, and shortening into the well, and work in until the dough is pliable and smooth. When dough is thoroughly kneaded, roll it out onto a floured board to a thickness of about 1/4 inch. Cut into roughly 4-inch rounds with a biscuit cutter. Holding one piece of dough in your hand, place a whole pitted plum in the center. Place another piece of dough on top, and press to seal the edges of the dough together. Make sure there are no leaks, or the plum will come out during cooking. To cook, bring a deep pot of salted water to boil. Place dumplings in water, and boil gently for about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, to make the sauce, melt butter in a large frying pan over medium heat. Stir in brown sugar. (If you like, stir in some of the juice that collects in the bowl of pitted plums.) Stir in a small amount of bread crumbs to slightly thicken the sauce. When dumplings are done, remove them from boiling water, and place them in the frying pan, and turn to coat the dumplings.

Place them in a thick-bottomed pan suitable for slow cooking and deep enough to allow frothing when the plums begin to boil. Add the water and cardamom pods and bring the mixture to a low boil over medium heat. Turn heat to low for a slow simmer and allow the fruit to cook down uncovered for 1 1/2 hours. Allow the plums to cool. To pit the plums, strain the cooled plums with a colander, pressing the juice out with your hands and collecting it in a large bowl. Pick up the pit-and-fruit slurry in the colander by small handfuls and squeeze the plum pulp and skins gently into the bowl with the syrup, retaining the pits in the palm of your hand and then discarding them. Put the plums back into the original pot with the sugar and butter. Cook at a very low simmer until the mixture begins to thicken, about 4 hours. To test for adequate development of pectin, drop a spoonful of the jam on a plate and put it in the refrigerator for a few minutes: the mixture should be soft-set and no longer syrupy. Ladle the hot jam into hot, sterile jars, wipe the rims clean, place sterile lids on, and tighten the screw caps. Allow the jars to cool to room temperature and check to be sure that each jar has sealed.

Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until prunes are tender, about 5 minutes. Drain and set aside. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a fluted tube pan (such as a Bundt®). Mix flour, 1 1/2 cups sugar, allspice, baking soda, nutmeg, cinnamon, and salt together in a mixing bowl. Combine vegetable oil, 1 cup buttermilk, and eggs in a separate bowl; pour them into the flour mixture. Mix until fully incorporated. Use an electric mixer to blend in the drained prunes; the mixer will break them up a bit. Stir in the chopped pecans. Pour batter into prepared pan and bake in preheated oven until a tester comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Remove cake from oven and allow it to cool for at least 10 minutes on a wire rack. To make icing, combine 1 cup sugar, margarine, 1/2 cup buttermilk, vanilla extract, and corn syrup in a saucepan and bring it to a boil over medium-high heat. Boil for a full 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Invert cake onto a platter and pour hot icing over the cake.

Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. In a large bowl, mash the sugar and margarine together until creamy, and beat in the eggs. In a separate bowl, sift the flour with baking powder and baking soda. Stir the flour mixture into the egg mixture in thirds, alternating with the mashed bananas until the batter is smooth and well combined.

                                         Rachel's Sugar Plum Spice Jam                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Place the plums, pineapple, apple juice, orange juice concentrate, and lemon juice into a large pot over medium-low heat, cover, and cook until the plums are soft, 15 to 20 minutes. Mash the plums and pineapple with a potato masher until thoroughly broken up, but leave small chunks of fruit in the mixture. With the fruit mixture at a slow simmer, stir in the cloves, allspice, pectin, and butter (to reduce foaming). Raise heat to high and bring the mixture to a full, rolling boil for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Mix in the sugar, stirring constantly, and cook for 1 more minute at a full, rolling boil. Remove from heat, stir in red food coloring until even in color, and skim off any foam. Sterilize 12-ounce canning jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack the plum jam into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then carefully lower the jars into the pot using a holder. Leave a 2 inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary until the water level is at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a full boil, cover the pot, and process for 10 minutes. Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area.

Add bread flour, and pour 1/4 cup sugar on the edge of the pan. Make a shallow hole in the flour and add the yeast. Close the lid, and set machine for the DOUGH cycle. While the dough is mixing, combine the prunes, prune juice, 1/4 cup sugar, cinnamon, cloves and lime juice in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, and simmer until prunes are soft and the sauce has thickened, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and blend in a mixer or food processor until smooth. When the bread machine signals the end of the dough cycle, transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into 20 small egg-sized pieces. Cover with greased plastic wrap, and set aside for 10 minutes. In a small bowl, mix together 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup flour. Stir in melted butter and 1 teaspoon cinnamon to make a crumbly streusel. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a large baking sheet or line it with parchment paper. Shape the kolache dough into balls and place them on the prepared baking sheet. Press a shallow hole in the center of each one, and fill with prune filling. Top each of the kolaches with streusel. Let the kolaches rest until doubled in size, about 20 minutes. Bake until the tops are lightly browned, 14 to 16 minutes.

Drain, and cool. When potatoes are cool enough to handle, peel, and press through a ricer into a large bowl. Set aside to cool. This part of the process can be done as much as one day in advance. In a large bowl, mix together the prepared potatoes, salt, egg, and 1 tablespoon of butter until well blended. Gradually stir in the farina, and then the flour. If dough is still wet, more flour can be mixed in. Turn dough out onto a floured surface, and knead until smooth, about 5 to 10 minutes. Split open each plum where it cracks, and remove the pit. Replace each pit with a sugar cube, and close. On a floured surface, roll out the dough to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut into twelve 3 inch squares. Place one plum into each square, and bring the corners around to the top. Pinch together all of the seams to seal. Bring a large pot of water to a slow boil. Place about 4 dumplings into the water at a time. Once they float to the surface, continue to cook them for about 5 more minutes. Transfer cooked dumplings to a covered bowl, and keep warm. Melt the remaining 1/2 cup of butter in a small skillet over medium heat. Stir in bread crumbs, and 1/4 cup of sugar. Continue to cook and stir until browned. Remove the bread crumbs to a plate, and roll warm dumplings in the mixture until entirely coated.

                            Zwetschgendatschi (German Plum Sheet Cake)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Combine flour and baking powder in a large bowl. Mix in 1 cup sugar, vanilla sugar, and salt. Add 1 1/3 cups butter and eggs. Knead everything into a smooth dough. Shape dough into a ball, press flat, cover, and chill in the refrigerator 1 hour to overnight. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet with butter. Cut halved plums in half again, without cutting all the way through, so they fan out. Roll pastry dough out on a lightly floured work surface. Line the bottom and sides of the prepared baking sheet with dough. Mix 2 tablespoons sugar and cinnamon together in a bowl. Arrange plums side by side on the pastry dough; very small plums should overlap. Dot plums with 2 tablespoons butter and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar and almonds. Bake in the preheated oven until pastry crust is lightly browned, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove from oven. Allow plum cake to cool, then cut into squares. Serve lukewarm or at room temperature.

Grease a shallow 2 quart baking dish. Place the pitted prunes in a saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to a simmer, and cook until the prunes are tender but still hold their shape, about 10 minutes. Drain the prunes and arrange them in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Whisk together the flour, white sugar, vanilla sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk in the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Gradually pour in the milk, stirring vigorously with a wooden spoon until combined. Stir in the rum. Pour the batter evenly over the prunes. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 400 degrees F, and bake until the filling is firm, has risen a little, and the top is browned, about 30 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Remove from heat and transfer to a bowl. Crumble the cake yeast into the milk mixture, and gently stir until the mixture becomes creamy. Cover the pan with a cloth, and set aside in a warm place until the yeast forms a spongy texture, 20 to 30 minutes. Melt margarine in a saucepan over low heat; remove from heat and allow to cool to lukewarm. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish, and sprinkle with bread crumbs. Place eggs and 1 1/8 cup sugar into a blender, and process until the mixture is yellow and fluffy. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together 8 cups of flour with vanilla sugar. Stir in the egg mixture, activated yeast mixture, and lukewarm margarine; start kneading 1 cup milk, or as needed, into the dough, a little at a time, until the dough stops sticking to your fingers and becomes smooth and even. Knead for at least 15 minutes, working to incorporate as much air as possible into the dough as you knead. Press the dough evenly into the prepared baking sheet, and arrange the plums over the top of the dough. Set aside. In a bowl, cut together 1 1/2 cup flour, the butter, and 1/2 cup of sugar with a pastry cutter until the mixture resembles fine crumbs; sprinkle the streusel mixture over the plums.

Transfer the ground fruit and onions into a large pot, and stir in the malt vinegar, sugar, salt, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, ginger, nutmeg, allspice, and cayenne pepper until the mixture is well combined. Bring to a simmer over low heat, and simmer until brown and thickened, about 3 to 4 hours. Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack the sauce into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot, and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then carefully lower the jars into the pot using a holder. Leave a 2 inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary until the water level is at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a full boil, cover the pot, and process for 10 minutes. Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area.

Line a baking sheet with foil. Season the pork tenderloin with salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in a heavy skillet over high heat until the oil shimmers; gently lay the tenderloin into the hot oil. After about 1 minute, gently loosen the meat from the bottom of the skillet, if necessary. Cook until the pork is seared a golden brown color, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer the pork to the lined baking sheet. Roast the seared tenderloin in the preheated oven until a thermometer inserted into the center of the pork reads at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), about 15 minutes. Remove the pork from the oven and allow to rest for 10 minutes before slicing into medallions. Cook the plums, balsamic vinegar, brown sugar, honey, and blueberry juice in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring often, until the plums are soft, about 10 minutes. Transfer the sauce to a blender and blend until smooth. Return the sauce to the saucepan and simmer until reduced and thickened to the consistency of apple butter, about 5 more minutes.

Butter a 9-inch square baking pan. Beat 1 cup sugar and 1 stick butter together using an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating after each addition. Add yogurt and vanilla extract; mix until batter is smooth. Add flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt to the batter and mix until just combined. Combine remaining 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon in a separate bowl. Spread batter evenly into the prepared pan and sprinkle with 1/2 of the cinnamon-sugar mixture. Top batter with plums and peaches; sprinkle with remaining cinnamon-sugar mixture.

With gloved hands, squeeze the plums in the colander, forcing the juice through the holes of the colander. Discard spent pulp, and repeat to produce 8 cups of plum juice. Pour 3/4 cup of plum juice into a small saucepan with garlic and onion, place over medium heat, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Pour the juice-onion mixture into a large pot, and add the remaining 7 1/2 cups of plum juice. Stir in the sugar, apple cider vinegar, Southwest chipotle seasoning, roasted garlic seasoning, jalapeno pepper, salt, and liquid smoke flavoring until the sugar and salt have dissolved. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, reduce heat to a simmer, and cook the sauce down until thickened, about 1 1/2 hours. Stir frequently to prevent burning. Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack the sauce into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then carefully lower the jars into the pot using a holder. Leave a 2 inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary until the water level is at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a full boil, cover the pot, and process for 10 minutes. Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area.

Mix prunes, apricots, ginger, orange zest, 1/2 teaspoon cumin, and cinnamon in a bowl; season with salt and black pepper. Open pork roast and spoon stuffing down the center; fold meat over stuffing and tie securely in several places with kitchen twine. Set roast onto a rack in a roasting pan. Combine brown sugar, flour, cider vinegar, 1 teaspoon cumin, and mustard powder into a paste; spread brown sugar mixture over the roast. Bake in the preheated oven until a meat thermometer inserted into center of stuffing reads 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 1 1/2 hours. Transfer roast to a serving platter and tent with aluminum foil while you make gravy. Skim fat from roasting pan and transfer defatted drippings into a small saucepan. Pour 1/2 cup water into roasting pan and scrape up and dissolve any browned bits of food into water; pour into saucepan with pan juices. Bring pan juices to a boil over medium heat. Dissolve cornstarch in 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl and whisk cornstarch mixture into pan juices, stirring constantly until thickened, about 1 minute. Strain gravy into a gravy boat.

If the mixture becomes too thick or starts to burn, add a tablespoon of water. Remove from heat, and allow to cool. Dissolve the gelatin in 1/2 cup of hot water in a bowl, and stir in the cooled plums, sugar, and lemon juice. Mix until the gelatin and sugar have dissolved. Chill the plum mixture in refrigerator until it begins to thicken, about 30 minutes. Whip the evaporated milk in a mixing bowl with an electric mixer until thick, then gently spoon the whipped milk into the plum mixture. Beat again with electric mixer until the dessert is fluffy and well combined. Chill for at least 3 hours before serving.

Set aside until foamy, about 10 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine flour, butter, sour cream, sugar, eggs, and egg yolks in a large bowl. Stir in yeast mixture. Mix well using an electric mixer at first, then using your hands. Turn out dough onto a floured work surface and knead until smooth, adding more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, if dough is sticking to your hands. Form dough into a long log and cut into 1 1/2-inch rounds. Cover rounds with a cloth. Roll each round of dough into a thin circle. Cut the circle into six triangles, as you would a pizza. Place 1 teaspoon jam at the wider end of each triangle, then roll up like a croissant. Place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat until all the dough is used up. Bake in the preheated oven until rogaliki have risen and are golden brown, about 20 minutes. Remove from oven and cool completely, about 30 minutes. Place confectioners' sugar in a bowl and stir in water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until a drizzling consistency is reached. Drizzle icing over cooled rogaliki.

Stop the machine, add eggs and egg yolks, and process in the machine until the mixture gathers itself up into one dough ball. If the dough doesn't ball up, stop the machine, sprinkle several drops of water onto the dough, and process again. Place the dough into a covered container and refrigerate at least 3 hours or preferably overnight. The next day, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Allow the dough to rest at room temperature for about 30 minutes to warm up. Roll out the dough on a well-floured surface to make a 9 1/2-inch circle. Dough will be rich and sticky. Scrape up the dough circle, and press into a 9-inch pie dish. Quarter and slice the plums, and place skin sides down onto the dough in a neat ring, starting at the outer edge and working in a neat row towards the center. Bake in the preheated oven until the plums are bubbling hot and the crust starts to brown, about 45 minutes. Allow the tart to cool, and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of sugar before serving.

Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place the plums into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. In a large bowl, mash together 2/3 cup butter with 1 1/2 cup of white sugar until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Beat in eggs, one at a time. Stir in 3 cups of flour, the baking powder, and salt. Mix in the milk and vanilla extract to make a smooth batter. Pour the batter over the plums.

Place the charred chiles in a plastic bag or in a large bowl covered with plastic wrap. Allow to sit for 5 to 10 minutes, then open and peel off the skin. Cut a slit in each chile lengthwise and remove the seeds. Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and cook until soft and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add ground pork and cook until browned, breaking up with a spoon while cooking, about 7 minutes. Mix in tomatoes, plantain, apple, peach, parsley, candied orange peel, pine nuts, raisins, almonds, cloves, salt, and pepper. Simmer until filling is cooked through and flavors are well combined, about 10 minutes. Combine walnuts, milk, goat cheese, sugar, and cinnamon stick in a blender; blend until walnut sauce is smooth and creamy. Fill each poblano chile with the pork filling and place on a plate. Spoon walnut sauce over chile and sprinkle with pomegranate seeds and parsley.

Generously season lamb chops with salt and black pepper. Heat vegetable oil in a Dutch oven over high heat. Place lamb chops in Dutch oven and cook until browned on all sides, about 8 minutes. Transfer lamb to a plate and reduce heat to medium. Stir onion and a pinch of salt into the Dutch oven; cook until onions are slightly golden, about 3 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Pour pomegranate juice into the Dutch oven and scrape any browned bits off of the bottom of the pot. Pour in balsamic vinegar, increase heat to high, and bring to a boil. Stir mint leaves, rosemary, and red pepper flakes into pomegranate juice mixture. Continue to boil until liquid is reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Return lamb and any accumulated juices to the Dutch oven, spoon pomegranate mixture over lamb, and cover. Cook in the preheated oven until lamb is fork tender, about 2 hours. Transfer lamb to a plate and set the Dutch oven on the stovetop over high heat. Bring pomegranate mixture to a boil; cook, skimming any fat that accumulates, until liquid is reduced by 1/3, about 5 minutes. Stir in honey and season with salt and black pepper.

Cut each in half again lengthwise, then in half cross-wise. Cut each piece in half to make about 16 evenly sized chunks. Transfer into pot; cover with water and add salt. Bring to a simmer on high heat; reduce heat to medium-low and cook until potatoes are tender, about 17 minutes. Drain thoroughly; return to pot and mash potatoes. You will need 1 1/2 cups mashed sweet potatoes. Cool thoroughly. Transfer cooled mashed potatoes to a mixing bowl. Add brown sugar and buttermilk. Mix together until well combined. Place self-rising flour in a separate mixing bowl. Grate frozen butter into flour, tossing with a fork to coat with flour after each addition of about 1/3 to 1/2 stick. This will prevent butter from clumping. Mixture should look like floury pieces of butter. Add sweet potato mixture. Toss with a fork until evenly distributed, but don't overmix. Transfer mixture onto a lightly floured work surface. Push and press mixture together into a rectangular shape, about 1 1/2 inches thick. Dough will be floury and a bit crumbly. Fold rectangle into thirds, lifting up one-third and folding onto the middle and doing the same with the other side. Dust with a bit of flour if sticking. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with a silicone mat. Press dough into a rectangle again, about 1 inch thick. Repeat the tri-fold step. Press out into a rectangle, about 1 inch thick. Trim off the rough edges to square off the sides; this will maximize rising. Cut into 8 equal portions. Transfer to prepared baking pan, spacing biscuits evenly. Brush tops lightly with 1 tablespoon melted butter. Bake in preheated oven until browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool slightly before serving. Mix 4 tablespoons butter (room temperature), pomegranate syrup, and pomegranate juice together in a small bowl. Spread on warm biscuits.

Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Invert a small bowl onto the parchment paper and trace the rim with a pencil. Repeat twice more. Flip parchment paper over. Beat egg whites in a large bowl with an electric mixer until soft peaks begin to form. Gradually add white sugar, with the mixer running. Whisk superfine sugar and cornstarch in a small bowl. Gradually beat into the meringue. Continue beating meringue until stiff, glossy peaks form. Beat in orange blossom water and vinegar. Spoon meringue into the traced circles. Make the borders higher than the center, to leave room for the filling. Bake meringues in the preheated oven until firm and dry to the touch, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, make the lemon curd. Fill a medium saucepan with 1 inch of water and bring to a bare simmer. Whisk lemon juice, lemon zest, sugar, egg yolks, and salt together in a glass bowl. Set the bowl over the simmering water. Cook, whisking constantly, until curd foams, then thickens, about 10 minutes. Remove the bowl from the simmering water. Gradually whisk in coconut oil until melted and incorporated. Strain the curd through a fine-mesh sieve; discard solids left in the strainer. Press a sheet of plastic wrap directly onto the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Transfer to the refrigerator. Turn off oven and keep meringues inside until completely dry, about 1 hour. Combine heavy cream, confectioners' sugar, and orange blossom water in a bowl. Beat with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Spoon lemon curd into the center of the cooled meringues. Mound whipped cream over the curd.

Pour sugar onto a second small plate, making a depth of 1/8 to 1/4 inch. Gently dip the rim of a champagne glass into the water. Raise the glass to allow excess water to drip off, then dip the rim into the sugar. Twist the glass to ensure the entire rim is coated. Discard remaining sugar. Place cranberries in the bottom of the champagne glass. Add cranberry-pomegranate juice, orange juice, and champagne.

Bring to a boil, and then reduce heat to simmer. Cook for 30 minutes. Chop the peeled apples, and place in a large saucepan. Remove zest from half of one orange, chop very fine, and add to apples. Peel oranges, chop coarsely, and add to pan along with cranberries and remaining juice and sugar. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to simmer, and cook for 30 minutes. Remove small pan from heat, and strain juice into larger pan. Cool solids slightly, and then push though a sieve to remove seeds and peels, adding remaining pulp to larger pan.

Line a roasting pan with a large sheet of aluminum foil. Toss butternut squash, shallot, 2 tablespoons canola oil, paprika, chili powder, chipotle powder, and ginger together in a bowl until evenly mixed and coated. Pour into prepared roasting pan and wrap aluminum foil around squash mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until squash is tender, 30 to 40 minutes. Heat 1 tablespoon canola oil in a cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir reserved butternut squash seeds, pinch salt, and pinch ground black pepper in the skillet until lightly toasted, 5 minutes. Add Brussels sprouts leaves and cook, stirring occasionally, until leaves are slightly crispy and seeds are browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir maple syrup into seed mixture and immediately remove from heat. Pour butternut squash mixture and almond milk into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until soup is smooth. Pour butternut squash soup into bowls and top with squash seeds and Brussels sprouts mixture, pomegranate seeds, and goat cheese.

Whisk in the cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and ginger. Crumble in half of the brown sugar and whisk mixture until sugar dissolves. Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat and swirl to coat the pan. Immediately pour in the juice/spice mixture and increase the heat to high. Bring mixture to a boil while whisking to prevent scorching. Reduce heat to medium and, while stirring, add the remaining brown sugar a little at a time. Cook and stir until mixture thickens to a syrupy consistency or when it can coat the back of a spoon. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly and continue to cool, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir and serve.

Season the pork roast with garlic, kosher salt, and pepper. Place in a roasting pan. Bake the roast for 1 hour in the preheated oven. While the roast is baking, combine the pomegranate seeds and water in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes, until the pomegranate seeds have broken down and released their juices. Press through a strainer to get as much juice as possible. You should have about 3/4 cup of juice. Pour the juice from the pomegranate into a saucepan and bring to a boil. Simmer over medium heat until reduced by half. Remove from the heat and mix in the balsamic vinegar, sugar, and cinnamon. After the roast has been in the oven for 45 minutes, baste it with pomegranate sauce, using a brush to apply it to the top and sides. Continue to roast the pork, basting every 10 minutes, until the internal temperature has reached 180 degrees F (80 degrees C), about 30 minutes.

Add broth and bring to a simmer. Cover pan and cook until water is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand 5 minutes. Transfer freekeh to a bowl to cool. Meanwhile, whisk vinegar, tahini, and honey together in a small bowl. Slowly drizzle in olive oil and whisk until combined. Season with salt and pepper. Add pomegranate seeds, onion, mint, and parsley to the bowl with the cooked freekeh. Drizzle in the dressing and toss to coat. Season with additional salt and pepper, if desired.

Stir in sliced onions; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low, and continue cooking and stirring until the onion is very tender and dark brown, 15 to 20 minutes more. Raise heat to medium-high. Add chicken pieces, and fry until lightly browned on the outside. Pour in the water, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for about 30 minutes, adding more water if necessary to keep the mixture from drying out. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (65 degrees C). Combine the walnuts and pomegranate juice in the container of a blender or food processor. Process into liquid. (This can be done in small batches if necessary.) Add walnut-pomegranate mixture to the simmering chicken. Season with cardamom, cinnamon, saffron powder, and salt. Stir in the cubed squash. Transfer the entire mixture to a 9x13-inch baking dish. Bake, loosely covered, for 2 1/2 hours in the preheated oven. Serve with white rice.

Strain through a fine-mesh sieve and discard the lime juice. Set the onions aside. Grind the serrano chile peppers, the juice of 2 limes, and salt together in a food processor until smooth; add the avocado and continue processing until creamy and smooth. Transfer the mixture into a small serving bowl; fold the soaked onions, chopped cilantro, and about half the pomegranate seeds into the avocado mixture. Top with the remaining pomegranate seeds and garnish with the cilantro sprig to serve.

Melt butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add white sugar, brown sugar, lemon juice, and cinnamon; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until sugar is dissolved. Line a 9-inch pie plate with 1 crust. Fill with sliced persimmons, mounding them slightly in the center. Pour sugar-butter mixture over the persimmons. Sprinkle cinnamon sugar over the second pie crust. Cut into strips. Make an X with the 2 longest strips in the center of the pie. Alternate horizontal and vertical strips, weaving them in an over-and-under pattern. Use the shortest strips for the edges of the lattice. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking until crust is golden brown, about 45 minutes more. Cool pie completely on a wire rack, about 2 hours.

Cover and cook on High for about 2 hours. Open the slow cooker and mash persimmons with a potato masher. Stir in agave, cinnamon, and cloves. Set the cooker to Low and cook, uncovered, 8 hours to overnight, stirring several times if possible, to prevent burning during the long cooking period. At the end of the cook time, inspect 4 (or more) half-pint jars for cracks and rings for rust, discarding any defective ones. Immerse in simmering water until persimmon mixture has finished cooking. Wash new, unused lids and rings in warm soapy water. Purée persimmon mixture with an immersion blender until smooth. If you don't have an immersion blender, purée mixture in batches in a blender, pulsing each batch a few times before leaving it on to purée. Pack persimmon butter into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings.

Chop the walnuts in a food processor until fine. Mix together in a bowl with the brown sugar and melted butter. Press the mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 12 minutes. Set aside to cool completely. Combine the persimmons, cream cheese, 1 1/4 cup sugar, 3/4 cup sour cream, cinnamon, and ginger in a food processor. Blend in processor until smooth, stopping occasionally to scrape edges of food processor bowl with a spatula. Add the eggs, one at a time, and process until fully incorporated. Pour the mixture over the cooled crust. Bake in the preheated oven until mostly set with the center being slightly jiggly, 60 to 75 minutes. While the cheesecake is baking, whisk together the 1 1/4 sour cream, 3 tablespoon white sugar, and vanilla extract. Spread evenly over the cheesecake while still hot and return to oven another 10 minutes. Allow to cool completely.

Grease a 9-inch round cake pan. Place the margarine and brown sugar in the cake pan and transfer the pan to the hot oven until the sugar is melted and bubbly, about 5 minutes. Remove from the oven; arrange the persimmon slices over the topping in the cake pan. Beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. The mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Stir in the persimmon pulp. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. Gradually add the flour mixture to the batter, stirring just to mix. The batter will be stiff, since the only liquid comes from the persimmon pulp. Stir in the pecans and lemon zest. Spoon the cake batter evenly over the persimmon slices and return the cake pan to the preheated oven. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before inverting the cake right-side-up on a serving platter.

Spray a 9x13 inch baking pan lightly with nonstick spray; set aside. Mix the persimmon pulp with the 2 cups sugar in a large bowl; set aside. Whisk together the eggs and baking soda in a small bowl. Add the egg mixture to the persimmon mixture and beat well; set aside. Whisk together the 1 cup flour, salt, baking powder, and cinnamon in a bowl. Stir 1/4 of the flour mixture to the persimmon mixture. Add 1/4 of the buttermilk and mix well. Continue alternating flour and buttermilk, adding 1/4 each time, and mixing well after each addition, until all of the flour mixture and buttermilk are incorporated. Stir in cream, honey, and melted butter until well combined. Pour the pudding batter into the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 1 hour. While baking, do not stir; Turn off the oven at the end of the baking time, but do not remove the pudding from the oven. Meanwhile, when the pudding has about 10 minutes of baking time left, make the sauce. Boil the water in a small saucepan. Whisk 1/2 cup sugar and 1 tablespoon flour together, and whisk sugar mixture into the boiling water, whisking until smooth. Boil the sauce for 5 minutes and remove from heat. Stir in vanilla. Pour the sauce mixture evenly over the pudding, and leave the pudding to cool in the warm oven for 20 more minutes, being sure that the oven is off so that the pudding does not continue to cook.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Lay persimmon slices onto the prepared baking sheet. Drizzle with 2 teaspoons olive oil and sprinkle salt on top. Sprinkle 1/2 the rosemary leaves over the persimmon slices. Roast in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Turn persimmon slices over and roast 10 minutes more. Remove baking sheet from the oven and increase temperature to 200 degrees C. Place focaccia on a baking sheet. Bake focaccia in the hot oven until warmed through, about 5 minutes. Remove from oven and top focaccia with roasted persimmon slices. Tear burrata cheese using your hands and lay evenly on the focaccia, avoiding the persimmon slices. Reserve about 1 tablespoon rosemary leaves and sprinkle the rest on top. Return focaccia to the hot oven and bake until warmed and burrata cheese has melted slightly, about 5 minutes.

Whisk the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and ginger in a bowl; set aside. Beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add the eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next. Beat in the persimmon pulp. Mix in the flour mixture until just incorporated. Drop spoonfuls of the dough 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven until slightly puffed and golden brown, about 12 minutes. Cool on the pan for 5 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.

Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan and dust the bottom with flour. Mix flour, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, ginger, and nutmeg together in a small bowl. Add walnuts and cranberries; toss or mix using your fingers to ensure cranberries don't stick together. Whisk eggs, brown sugar, and oil together in a medium bowl until eggs are well beaten. Stir in persimmon pieces followed by flour mixture. Pour into the prepared loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, 1 hour and 15 minutes to 1 1/2 hours. Remove from the oven and let cool on a wire rack for 15 minutes.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a Silpat® nonstick baking mat. Mash persimmon pulp in a small bowl and stir in baking soda to let mixture congeal. Beat white sugar and 1/2 cup butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Stir flour, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and salt together in a second bowl. Mix egg into the persimmon mixture. Add persimmon mixture and flour mixture to the creamed butter mixture and stir well to combine. Fold pecans and raisins into the batter. Drop batter onto the prepared baking sheet using a medium cookie scoop. Bake in the preheated oven until slightly browned and puffy, 13 to 15 minutes. Remove from oven and cool completely on wire racks, about 30 minutes. Mix confectioners' sugar, maple syrup, 1 tablespoon melted butter, vanilla extract, and salt in a bowl until maple glaze is smooth. Place a sheet of parchment paper under the wire rack to catch the drips. Drizzle maple glaze onto the cookie tops using a spoon. Let set until glaze hardens, about 30 minutes. Cut green belt candy into small leaf shapes using kitchen scissors. Combine white chocolate and shortening in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl and melt in the microwave in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 3 minutes. Drip some melted white chocolate over each cookie using a spoon. Place one red candy-coated chocolate piece in the middle of each cookie and add a green belt leaf to each side.

Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan, preferably glass. Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Stir bananas, milk, and cinnamon in another bowl. Beat sugar and butter together in a third bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy; add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir banana mixture into butter mixture; mix in flour mixture until just blended. Fold in chocolate chips; pour batter into the prepared loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 70 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.

Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners. Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl; set aside. Mix bananas, sugar, egg, and melted butter in a separate large bowl until well combined; fold in flour mixture until smooth. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full. Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 25 to 30 minutes. Cool briefly in the tin, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan. Stir sugar and melted butter together in a large bowl. Add eggs and vanilla; mix well. Combine flour, baking soda, and salt; stir into butter mixture until smooth. Fold in banana slices, sour cream, and walnuts; transfer into the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean, about 1 hour.

Grease and flour two 9x5-inch loaf pans. Sift flour, baking soda, and salt into a large bowl. Cream sugar and butter together in a separate bowl. Stir in bananas, eggs, and walnuts until well blended. Pour wet ingredients into flour mixture and stir just until blended. Divide the batter evenly between the two prepared pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a paring knife inserted into the crown of each loaf comes out clean, 60 to 70 minutes. Remove from the oven and let loaves cool in the pans for at least 5 minutes. Turn out onto a cooling rack, and let cool completely, about 30 minutes. Slice and serve. For more intense flavor, wrap each loaf in aluminum foil to keep in the moisture, then refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving.

Grease and flour a 9x13-inch pan. Make cake: Mix mashed bananas with lemon juice in a small bowl. Mix flour, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl. Cream sugar and butter in a large bowl until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in vanilla. Beat in flour mixture alternately with buttermilk. Stir in banana mixture. Pour batter into the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour. Remove cake from the oven and place it directly into the freezer for 45 minutes. This will make the cake very moist. Meanwhile, make frosting: Cream butter and cream cheese until smooth. Beat in vanilla. Add confectioners sugar and beat on low speed until combined, then on high until frosting is smooth. Spread frosting on cooled cake.

Line the air fryer basket, if desired. Place banana slices into the basket, making sure that they are not touching; cook in batches if necessary. Mist banana slices with avocado oil. Cook in the air fryer for 5 minutes. Remove the basket and flip banana slices carefully (they will be soft). Cook until banana slices are browned and caramelized, an additional 2 to 3 minutes. Carefully remove from basket.

Grease 3 mini loaf pans. Mix together flour, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl. Beat sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light in color and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in vanilla extract; beat in mashed bananas. Add flour mixture a little at a time, beating until just combined into a thick batter. Fold in blueberries until evenly distributed. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes.

Remove ribs and seeds; rinse peppers. Chop edible portion of the tops; set aside. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add peppers, reduce heat, and simmer until tender but still firm, about 5 minutes. Drain and set aside. Heat butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Sauté reserved chopped pepper, onion, and celery in hot butter until tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and garlic. Season with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, basil, oregano, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Simmer uncovered for 10 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Meanwhile, combine Parmesan cheese, egg, Worcestershire sauce, 1 remaining teaspoon salt, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon black pepper in a large bowl. Mix in hot sausage, mild sausage, bread crumbs, and 1 cup tomato sauce mixture until well combined. Fill each pepper with sausage mixture using a piping bag or sausage stuffer. Place in a 3-quart casserole dish; pour remaining tomato sauce mixture over peppers. Bake uncovered in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbly and sausage is cooked through, about 1 hour.

Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan. Place the bananas into a large plastic zipper bag, seal the bag, and smoosh the bananas with your fingers until very well mashed. Set the bananas aside. Place the brown sugar and butter into a mixing bowl, and mix on medium speed with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Cut a corner from the plastic bag, and squeeze the mashed bananas into the bowl of brown sugar mixture. With the electric mixer on medium speed, beat in the bananas, egg, cinnamon, vanilla extract, and milk until the mixture is well combined. Switch the mixer to low speed, and gradually beat in the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and kosher salt just until the batter is smooth, about 1 minute. Spread the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until the bread is set and lightly browned on top, about 40 minutes.

Grease and flour two 9-inch cake pans. Make cake: Sift together flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Combine bananas, oil, walnuts, pineapple, and eggs in another large bowl; mix well. Stir flour mixture into banana mixture until combined. Pour batter into the prepared pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of each pan comes out clean, about 1 hour. Allow cakes to cool on wire racks. Meanwhile, make frosting: Beat together confectioners' sugar, cream cheese, butter, and vanilla in a medium bowl until smooth. Evenly spread frosting on the middle, sides, and top of cooled cake.

Grease a muffin pan or line with paper liners. Cream together butter and brown sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until fluffy. Add mashed bananas, eggs, milk, and vanilla; mix well. Stir in flour, bran, baking powder, baking soda, and salt; blend just until moistened. Stir in walnuts. Pour batter into the prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.

Lightly grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan. Cream sugar and butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in mashed bananas. Sift together flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl; beat into banana mixture just until combined. Fold in nuts. Pour batter into the prepared pan.

Add sugar, salt, and 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon flour to the yolks. Splash in about 1/4 of the milk and start blending mixture with a whisk. Pour in remaining milk and whisk until smooth. Cook and stir mixture over medium heat until hot to the touch, occasionally dipping your finger in to test. Whisk constantly until custard is thick enough to form ribbons. Remove custard from heat and add vanilla extract, banana liqueur, and cold butter. Whisk until butter dissolves. Set custard aside. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Toss banana slices with lemon juice. Spread a quarter of the custard over the bottom of a baking dish. Add a single layer of vanilla wafers. Cover with 1/2 of the bananas and spread 1/2 of the remaining custard on top. Add another layer of vanilla wafers, using slightly fewer this time. Top with the remaining bananas and custard. Smooth the top and tap dish against the counter to settle the pudding. Add cream of tartar to the egg whites. Beat using the whisk attachment until foamy. Gradually add sugar and beat until stiff, but not dry, peaks form. Spread meringue over the pudding using a soft spatula, creating ridges for contrast. Bake in the preheated oven until meringue is nicely browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Serve warm or chilled.

Grease an 8x4-inch loaf pan and set aside. Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Set aside. Mash bananas in another bowl and stir in eggs and sugar. Stir the flour mixture into the banana mixture just to combine, then fold in walnuts. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the bread comes out clean, 55 to 65 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool on a rack for 10 minutes, then remove from the pan and cool completely. Slice and serve.

Grease an 8-inch square baking pan. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Remove from the heat and stir in chocolate chips until melted. Set aside to cool for 5 minutes. While the chocolate mixture is cooling, lightly beat egg in a medium bowl. Stir in brown sugar, mashed banana, vanilla, and salt until well combined. Stir cooled melted chocolate mixture into banana mixture until well combined. Stir in flour until just incorporated. Spread batter into the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until the top is dry and the edges have started to pull away from the sides of the pan, about 30 minutes. Let pan cool on a wire rack before cutting into 16 squares.

Bring to a boil and then add the sugar; stir to dissolve, reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack the jam into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then carefully lower the jars into the pot using a holder. Leave a 2 inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary until the water level is at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars.

Add minced onion, tomato, kiwi, juice from 2 lime wedges, 3/4 of the cilantro, salt, and pepper to a small bowl. Mix into a salsa. Juice 1/4 of the lime into another small bowl; mix in sour cream to make the crema. Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add sliced onion and poblano pepper. Cook, tossing occasionally, until softened and lightly charred, 3 to 4 minutes. Add pork and Mexican seasoning. Cook until pork is browned throughout, 4 to 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low. Add chicken stock, tomato paste, salt, and pepper. Cook and stir until everything is coated, 1 to 2 minutes. Wrap tortillas in a damp cloth and microwave for 30 seconds. Divide tortillas over plates; spread cream on top. Top tortillas with pork mixture and salsa. Garnish with remaining cilantro.

Spread 1 side of each bread slice with whipped cream. Arrange fruit pieces in a diagonal row on 2 of the bread slices, working from 1 corner to the opposite corner. Fill in the areas on both sides of the row with remaining fruit pieces, cutting to fit as necessary. Top with remaining bread slices, cream-sides down. Tightly wrap sandwiches in plastic wrap.

Grease interior of 8 inch springform pan and dust lightly with cornstarch. Beat egg whites, preferably in a glass or ceramic bowl, until stiff and glossy. Make sure egg whites have absolutely no contact with grease (fresh or residual), or even a speck of yolk. Combine cream of tartar, white sugar, and cornstarch; gradually beat in to the egg whites. Sprinkle vinegar over egg white mixture, then fold it in very gently. Pile meringue into prepared pan. Spread to the sides leaving a slight depression in the center. Place in preheated oven. Close the oven door, and immediately turn oven down to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Bake for 75 to 90 minutes. Open oven door, but leave meringue in the oven for 15 more minutes. Remove meringue to a draft free spot. Very carefully remove rim of springform pan, and allow meringue to cool completely. There may be a slight sinking in the center. Carefully remove meringue from pan base, and place on serving platter. Whip cream, vanilla extract, and confectioners' sugar until thick and firm. Gently spread over the meringue. Remove the pulp from the passion fruit, and spoon over cream. If using kiwi, peel and slice the fruit; arrange slightly overlapping slices in a pleasing design. Chill until serving time.

You will be turning the temperature down to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) when you put this in to bake. Line a 9 or 10 inch round glass dish with parchment paper. Combine the egg whites and salt in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer, or stand mixer using a whisk attachment until able to form soft peaks. Sprinkle in the sugar 1 tablespoon at a time while continuing to whip to stiff peaks. Stir in the vanilla and vinegar, and fold in coconut if using. Spread evenly into the prepared glass dish, making sure to spread out to all of the edges. Place the Pavlova into the oven, and immediately reduce the temperature to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Bake for 40 to 50 minutes, or until the top is crisp and a pale straw color. Leave in the oven, and turn off the heat. Let it stay in the oven until the oven has cooled completely. Once the Pavlova is cooled, top generously with sweetened whipped cream. Arrange the strawberries, kiwis, peaches and blueberries in beautiful concentric circles on top.

Add pork belly. Seal bag, pressing out as much air as possible. Place bag on a plate and marinate pork belly in the refrigerator, flipping occasionally, for at least 2 days. Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C) with a rack in the upper third of the oven. Set a wire rack on a rimmed baking sheet. Place pork belly on the wire rack, reserving marinade. Bake pork belly in the preheated oven until the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F (71 degrees C), about 1 hour. Remove pork belly from the oven; baste with reserved marinade. Move oven rack to the top position and preheat the oven's broiler. Broil pork until it is dark and glossy and the edges start to blacken, about 5 minutes. Flip and baste on the second side. Continue broiling until second side darkens and starts to blacken, about 5 minutes more. Slice with a sharp knife.

Mix crushed pretzels, butter, and brown sugar together in a bowl; press into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes; set aside to cool completely. Crust will be soft when taken out of the oven and will harden as it cools. Mix white sugar, cream cheese, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl until smooth. Stir juice from 1/2 lemon and lemon zest into cream cheese mixture and mix well; fold in whipped topping. Spread cream cheese mixture evenly over cooled crust; refrigerate until set, about 30 minutes. Mix boiling water and lemon-flavored gelatin mix together in a bowl until dissolved. Add 1/2 cup strained lemon juice and mix well. Refrigerate gelatin mixture until slightly thickened, about 1 hour. Ladle enough gelatin mixture over cream cheese layer to cover, setting remaining gelatin mixture aside.

Grease two baking sheets. Cream together the butter, kiwi, brown sugar and white sugar in a large bowl, until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition, then stir in the vanilla extract. Combine flour, baking soda, and toasted oat cereal in a bowl; gradually stir into the creamed mixture. Finally, fold in the chocolate chips. Drop by rounded spoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheets. Bake in preheated oven until light brown, about 8 to 10 minutes.

Refrigerate until cold, about 30 minutes. In a separate bowl, lightly mix together the chopped strawberries, pineapple, grapes, and the blueberries. Scoop about 3 tablespoons of the cream cheese mixture into the bottom of each plastic cup to make a half-inch thick layer. Spoon enough mixed fruit on top of the cream cheese to make a 2-inch layer, about 1/3 cup. Top the fruit with a teaspoon or two of crumbled sugar cookies. Garnish each trifle with a kiwi slice. Refrigerate until serving time.

Combine the kiwi, mango, and banana in a bowl. Process the strawberries in a blender until they are liquefied and pour over fruit mixture. Stir to coat and refrigerate. Coat both sides of each tortilla with the cooking spray. Cut them into triangle-shaped wedges and place on a baking sheet. Sprinkle cinnamon sugar evenly over the chips.

Add tilapia fillets, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour. Meanwhile, make the salsa: Combine mango, bell pepper, jalapeño pepper, red onion, and cilantro in a bowl. Add lime and lemon juices and toss well. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove tilapia from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard remaining marinade. Grill fillets until fish is no longer translucent in the center and flakes easily with a fork, 3 to 4 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of the fillets.

Cool, then remove the peel and inner seed; place mango pulp in a large bowl. Use a fork or potato masher to mash the pulp well. Stir together sugar and water in a large saucepan over low heat, and bring to a boil. When the mixture begins boiling, increase heat to medium-high. Continue boiling until fine, soft threads form, 270 degrees F (135 degrees C). Stir in mango pulp, add saffron threads, and boil until the mixture thickens, about 5 minutes.

Place wings on a baking sheet and refrigerate to dry a bit more. Combine mango nectar, brown sugar, habanero peppers, soy sauce, sriracha sauce, and vinegar in a food processor. Mix until peppers are pureed; seeds will still be visible. Remove food processor lid carefully; the pepper fumes can be strong. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add minced garlic; cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the mango-habanero mixture immediately; bring to a simmer, stirring frequently. Reduce heat to medium-low; add honey. Simmer, stirring frequently, until sauce is reduced by 75% and thickened to a glaze, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Remove from heat. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat wings lightly with cornstarch. Place 5 to 6 wings in the hot oil; fry until golden brown and crispy, about 8 minutes. Place wings on a paper towel to absorb excess oil; transfer to the preheated oven to keep warm. Repeat until all wings have been fried and drained. Place wings in a large bowl. Pour half the sauce over the wings and mix, coating the wings with the sauce. Continue adding the remaining sauce until you have coated the wings to your liking.

Add the mahi mahi and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour. Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack in the middle of the oven. Bring the rice, water, chicken bouillon, and 1 tablespoon butter to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the liquid has been absorbed, about 20 minutes. Pour in the coconut milk and 2 tablespoons of sugar. Stir, and simmer uncovered until the rice has absorbed most of the coconut milk. While the rice is cooking, remove the mahi mahi from the marinade, and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade. Place fish in a large baking dish in a single layer. Broil in the preheated oven until the fish flakes easily with a fork, 10 to 15 minutes. If the fish browns too quickly, cover the baking dish with a sheet of aluminum foil. Melt 1 1/2 teaspoons butter and 1 1/2 tablespoons of sugar in a skillet over medium-high heat. When the mixture begins to bubble, stir in mango cubes. Cook and stir until mango is tender, about 5 minutes. Serve by placing a mahi mahi fillet over a scoop of hot rice and top with the mango salsa.

Line a 9-inch pie pan with half of the pie pastry. Set aside. Combine mango, sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, and cinnamon in a bowl; stir until the sugar has dissolved. Transfer mango mixture into the prepared pie pan. Dot the mixture with the butter, then cover with the top crust. Pinch the edges of the top and bottom crusts together to seal. Cut several vents on the top crust. Bake in the preheated oven until the crust is golden brown and the juices are bubbling, about 45 minutes.

Grease a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt®). Peel mango with a vegetable peeler or paring knife. Cut flesh into small pieces and squeeze pit for juice. Collect all juice from chopping and squeezing pit and reserve for glaze. Smash mango in a bowl using a potato masher or fork. Measure 1 cup smashed mango, reserving the rest for the glaze. Beat 1 cup smashed mango, cake mix, eggs, water, vegetable oil, and lime zest together in a bowl using an electric mixer for 2 minutes; pour into the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes. Cool cake in pan for 5 minutes. Invert cake onto a wire rack to cool completely. Combine butter, lime juice, about 1 tablespoon reserved juice from mango, and rum together in a bowl.

Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Beat mango pulp, sugar, margarine, and eggs together in a bowl using an electric mixer on medium speed until light and well mixed, 3 to 5 minutes. Sift flour, baking powder, and baking soda together in a bowl. Stir mango mixture into flour mixture just until batter is combined. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Gently press almonds into batter. Continue baking until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean, about 20 minutes.

Rub the tuna steaks with the mixture. Place the steaks in a sealable container and chill in refrigerator 3 hours. Combine the mango, bell pepper, Spanish onion, green onion, cilantro, and jalapeno pepper in a bowl; stir. Add the lime juice and 1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil and toss to combine. Chill in refrigerator 1 hour. Stir together the paprika, cayenne pepper, onion powder, salt, pepper, thyme, basil, oregano, and garlic powder in a bowl. Remove the tuna steaks from the refrigerator and gently rinse with water and then dip each side of each steak in the spice mixture to coat. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Gently lay the tuna steaks into the hot oil. Cook the tuna on one side for 3 minutes; remove to a plate. Pour the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil into the skillet and let it get hot. Lay the tuna with the uncooked side down into the skillet and cook another 3 minutes; remove from heat immediately.

Sprinkle salt over the mango. Pour water over the mango. Let mango soak for 1 hour to overnight. Drain and discard liquid from the mango. Stir sugar and vinegar together in a saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil. Add drained mango to the liquid; stir to coat. Stir raisins, dates, cinnamon sticks, ginger, garlic, and ground dried chile pepper into the mango mixture; bring again to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to low and simmer mixture until thickened, about 1 hour. Remove from heat to cool completely. Sterilize jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack chutney into hot, sterilized jars, filling to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids and screw on rings. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars into the boiling water using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary to bring the water level to at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process for 15 minutes. Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all).

Stir in the red pepper flakes and cook until they begin to sizzle, then stir in the minced onion. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally until the onions have softened, about 20 minutes. Remove the lid, increase the heat to medium, and stir in the ginger and yellow bell pepper. Cook and stir until the ginger is fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the mangoes, pineapple, brown sugar, curry powder, and vinegar. Bring to a simmer, and cook for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Combine mangoes, water, and 1/2 cup white sugar in a saucepan over medium heat; simmer until sugar is dissolved, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain syrup from mangoes, reserving syrup. Beat 2 cups sugar and butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a separate bowl until combined. Slowly mix flour mixture, alternating with milk, into creamed butter mixture, beating well after each addition. Stir vanilla extract into batter; pour into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange mangoes on top of the batter and pour 2 cups reserved syrup over mangoes. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cobbler comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes.

Add lime juice, cilantro, and salt; mix to combine. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate. Sprinkle seafood rub, chili powder, salt, and black pepper over 1 side of each salmon steak; rub in with your fingers until evenly distributed. Coat the bottom of a large skillet with olive oil and heat over medium-high heat. Add salmon skin-side down and cook until skin is crisp, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip salmon and carefully peel off skin. Season top with seafood rub, chili powder, salt and black pepper. Continue cooking until lightly browned on the second side and salmon flakes easily with a fork, 4 to 5 minutes. Slice each salmon fillet lengthwise to create 6 pieces. Lightly oil another skillet over medium heat. Pan-fry corn tortillas, one at a time, until heated through and pliable, about 30 seconds per side. Place 1 piece of salmon on each tortilla. Top with salsa. Squeeze a wedge of lime on top.

Bring to a simmer; mash mangos and pineapple to a chunky consistency with a potato masher. Stir in sugar until dissolved. Stir liquid pectin and habanero chile halves into the stockpot. Bring to a rolling boil, stirring frequently. Cook, stirring frequently, until jam thickens, about 2 minutes. Remove chile halves. Discard 6 chile halves; chop 2 halves and stir back into the stockpot. Sterilize 8 half-pint jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Ladle hot jam into the hot, sterilized jars, filling to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a clean knife around the insides of the jars to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with the lids and screw on the rings. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars into boiling water using a holder, spacing them 2 inches apart. Pour in more boiling water to cover jars by at least 1 inch. Bring water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process for 10 minutes. Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool, about 8 hours. Press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all).

Add most of the brown sugar, reserving 1 teaspoon. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low; cook for 5 minutes. Add habanero peppers and simmer for 2 minutes. Mix 2 tablespoon water with cornstarch; stir slurry into the saucepan. Cook over medium-high until thick, 3 to 5 minutes. Leave mixture chunky or blend for a smoother texture. For the filling: Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add chicken thighs and sauté until browned, 5 to 7 minutes; sprinkle jerk seasoning over chicken. Add shallot and garlic; cook and stir until shallot begins to soften, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium; add cabbage, carrots, and reserved sugar. Cook until cabbage is translucent but still a little crunchy, 3 to 5 minutes. Taste for seasoning. Let mixture cool. Heat remaining vegetable oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Fry plantains until they start to brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer plantains onto a paper towel and let cool. Separate and place egg roll wrappers onto your work surface. Mix egg with water for egg wash. Lay out one wrapper with a corner pointed toward you. Use a slotted spoon to add some of the chicken and cabbage mixtures across the center. Sprinkle plantain bits on top. Use your finger or a pastry brush to lightly moisten edges of wonton wrappers with egg wash. Fold one corner of the wrapper over filling onto the opposite corner to form a triangle. Press edges together to seal. Fill and fold remaining egg rolls. Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Fry egg rolls in batches in hot oil, turning occasionally, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove and drain on paper towels or a rack.

Lightly grease a 9-inch springform pan. Combine coconut, gingersnap cookies, and melted butter in a bowl; mix until evenly moistened. Press cookie mixture into the bottom and slightly up the sides of the prepared pan. Bake crust in the preheated oven until browned and set, about 10 minutes. Set aside to cool. Reduce oven heat to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Beat softened cream cheese in a mixing bowl until smooth. With the beater set to medium-low, slowly pour condensed milk into the bowl, mixing only until just blended and stopping to scrape the sides of the bowl as necessary. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition; scrape the sides of the bowl as necessary. Pour about 1/2 of the cream cheese batter into a separate bowl. Stir lime zest and lime juice into portion in the new bowl; pour batter over crust in the springform pan, smoothing into an even layer. Stir coconut extract through remaining cream cheese batter; pour over lime-flavored batter in the springform pan, smoothing into an even layer. Bake in the preheated oven until top of cheesecake springs back when gently pressed, about 45 minutes. Turn oven heat off, but leave cheesecake inside with the oven door slightly ajar until the oven cools completely. Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled. Prepare mango coulis by puréeing mango with sugar in a blender until smooth. If too thick, add 1 teaspoon water at a time, using just enough to make it pourable. Drizzle over cheesecake when plated.

Process until smooth. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine mango, cream, and lemon juice. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until thickened. Season fish with salt and black pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and crushed garlic in a large skillet over medium heat. Sear the sea bass on both sides, and remove from heat. Transfer fish to preheated oven, and roast until cooked through.

In a bowl, lightly toss mango, pineapple, red bell pepper, black beans, red onion, and cilantro in a bowl; pour lime juice over mango mixture and toss again. Cover the bowl and refrigerate until chilled, at least 30 minutes. Whisk together egg and milk in a bowl. In a separate shallow bowl, stir panko crumbs with coconut. Stir about 1 tablespoon of the spice mix, or to taste, into the panko crumb mixture. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Dip tilapia fillets into egg mixture, then press gently into panko crumb mixture to coat both sides of fillets. Brush off any loose crumbs, then lay fillets into the hot oil. Pan-fry until fish is opaque inside and golden brown outside, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Serve with mango salsa.

Place the pits into a slow cooker, then roughly chop the mango and set aside. Place the pork shoulder into the slow cooker, and season with the black pepper, kosher salt, and 1 teaspoon chipotle powder; pour in the balsamic vinegar and water. Cover, and cook on Low 5 to 8 hours until the meat is very tender. Once done, drain the pork, discarding the cooking liquid and mango pits, and shred with two forks. While the pork is cooking, puree the chopped mango in a blender until smooth, then pour into a saucepan along with the honey, 1 teaspoon chipotle powder, and whiskey. Bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, stirring frequently until the mango has reduced and darkened slightly, about 10 minutes. Stir in the barbeque sauce, and remove from the heat.

Place ham, cut-side down, into a roasting pan. Cut skin off pineapple with a sharp knife and slice off any brown spots or skin left behind. Cut pineapple into 1/2-inch-thick rings and use a round cutter to remove cores. Pin rings onto ham with toothpicks. Bake ham in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. While ham bakes, mix pineapple juice and brown sugar in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on medium power until glaze is boiling and slightly thickened. Work carefully because glaze will be sticky and very hot. Pour 1/2 of the glaze evenly over ham and pineapple rings. Bake ham for 30 minutes more, then pour remaining glaze over ham. Continue baking ham until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of ham reads 140 degrees F (60 degrees C), 30 to 60 minutes more. dotdash meredith food studios                        Total Fat 26g 33%, Saturated Fat 9g 45%, Cholesterol 99mg 33%, Sodium 68mg 3%, Total Carbohydrate 16g 6%, Dietary Fiber 0g 1%, Total Sugars 15g, Protein 24g, Vitamin C 14mg 70%, Calcium 21mg 2%, Iron 1mg 8%, Potassium 492mg 10%

Cut about 1/2-inch off top of garlic head. Trim root, so garlic sits flat. Remove outer layers of papery skin, leaving enough so cloves remain intact. Place garlic into a small baking dish, drizzle olive oil on top, and cover with a lid or aluminum foil. Roast garlic in the preheated oven until cloves are soft and fragrant, about 1 hour. Stir brown sugar, pineapple juice, water, teriyaki sauce, and soy sauce together in a saucepan and bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and keep at a simmer. Squeeze sides of garlic until pasty roasted garlic emerges. Measure 2 teaspoons roasted garlic into the saucepan and whisk until incorporated. Reserve remaining roasted garlic for another use. Stir lemon juice, onion, bourbon whiskey, pineapple, and cayenne pepper into sauce. Bring to a simmer and cook until liquid reduces by half and turns thick and syrup-like, 40 to 50 minutes.

Spoon a heaping tablespoon of crushed pineapple on top and compact it with the back of a spoon into an even layer. Mix pineapple cake mix, pineapple juice, vegetable oil, and eggs in a large bowl with an electric mixer on low speed until moistened, about 30 seconds. Increase speed to medium; mix for 2 minutes. Pour batter into the muffin cups, filling them to the top; do not overfill. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Line a work surface with waxed paper. Allow cupcakes to cool at least 5 minutes before inverting muffin cups onto the waxed paper; serve with pineapple and cherry sides up. Sprinkle cupcakes lightly with confectioners' sugar before serving.

Place ham in a roasting pan. Use a sharp knife to score ham rind with a diamond pattern. Press a clove into the center of each diamond. Drain juice from pineapple rings into a medium bowl; stir in lemon-lime soda and brown sugar. Coat ham with juice mixture and arrange pineapple rings on ham. Place a maraschino cherry in the center of each pineapple ring and secure with a toothpick. Bake uncovered, basting frequently with pan juices, in the preheated oven until the internal temperature of the ham is 160 degrees F (72 degrees C), 4 to 5 hours.

Melt 1/2 cup butter over very low heat in a 10-inch heavy skillet with a heat-resistant handle or a cast iron pan. Remove from heat; sprinkle brown sugar evenly into the skillet. Arrange pineapple slices to cover the bottom of the skillet. Distribute cherries around pineapples; set aside. Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl; set aside. Separate eggs; place whites in a large mixing bowl and yolks in a smaller bowl. Beat egg whites on medium speed until soft peaks form. Add white sugar gradually, beating well after each addition. Beat until medium-stiff peaks form. Beat egg yolks at high speed until very thick and yellow. Using a wire whisk or rubber scraper, gently fold egg yolks and flour mixture into whites with an over-and-under motion until blended. Fold 1 tablespoon melted butter and almond extract into batter, then spread batter evenly over pineapple in the skillet. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Loosen cake edges with a table knife. Cool cake for 5 minutes before inverting it onto a serving plate.

Shape into 1 1/2-inch balls. Sauté meatballs in a large skillet over medium-high heat until browned, about 10 minutes. While the meatballs are cooking, prepare the sauce: Pour pineapple juice into a liquid measuring cup, and reserve pineapple chunks; add enough water to pineapple juice to make 1 cup. Mix brown sugar and cornstarch in a small bowl. Transfer meatballs to a plate, reserving the pan drippings. Add pineapple juice and brown sugar mixtures to the warm pan drippings. Stir in vinegar and soy sauce and bring to a boil. Cook until sauce thickens, 2 to 3 minutes. Return meatballs to the skillet; add pineapple chunks, and green pepper.

Remove chops from the skillet, and set aside. Mix the chicken broth, soy sauce and vinegar into the skillet, and bring to a boil. Return the pork chops to the skillet, reduce heat, and simmer 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove chops from the skillet, reserving broth mixture, and set aside. In a bowl, blend the brown sugar, cornstarch, and pineapple juice. Mix into the skillet with the chicken broth mixture. Bring to a boil. Serve with the cooked pork chops.

Combine pineapple juice, vinegar, orange juice, lime juice, onion, garlic, chipotle peppers, chili powder, cumin, salt, pepper, and sazon in a blender; blend until smooth. Pour sauce over the pork and make sure all chunks of meat are covered. Seal the container and marinate for at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours. Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot) and select Saute function. Add vegetable oil and heat until hot. Add chunks of marinated pork and brown on all sides, reserving extra sauce, about 5 minutes. You may need to work in batches depending on the size of your Instant Pot. Turn off Saute mode and pour reserved sauce over the pork. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 35 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build. Release pressure first using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 10 minutes. Release remaining pressure using the manufacturer's quick release method, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Remove the pork chunks from the pot using tongs or a slotted spoon, and place them on the baking sheet. Reserve the sauce in the Instant Pot® for now. Use forks to coarsely shred the pork, removing and discarding any excess fatty chunks. Spread meat out evenly on the prepared baking sheet. Add pineapple chunks to the baking sheet with the meat, then place the baking sheet under the broiler. Broil until the tips of the meat and pineapple are beginning to get a little brown and crispy, about 5 minutes. Remove from the oven. Use a spoon to drizzle the reserved sauce from the Instant Pot over the meat to moisten it and add some more of the marinade flavor.

Grease and flour three 8-inch round pans. Cream margarine in a large bowl until smooth. Blend in eggs. Add cake mix and pineapple with juice; mix until smooth. Stir in pecans. Pour batter into the prepared pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 30 minutes. Cool cakes in pans on wire racks for 5 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto cooling racks. Let cool completely, about 1 hour. To make frosting: Beat margarine and cream cheese in a medium bowl until smooth.

Arrange in a single layer between two sheets of plastic wrap and pound with a meat mallet until each is about 1-inch thick. Generously season with salt and black pepper. Whisk ketchup, rice vinegar, reserved pineapple juice, brown sugar, garlic, hot chili sauce, soy sauce, and red pepper flakes in a bowl. Set aside. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over high heat. Place pork in pan; reduce heat to medium. Cook until browned on both sides and cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate. Return skillet to medium heat. Stir butter into hot pan. When butter melts and starts to brown, stir in pineapple chunks. Cook, stirring, until pineapple is golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in ketchup mixture and 1/4 cup green onion (white parts).

Cook orzo in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl. Add mandarin oranges, pineapple chunks, crushed pineapple, and maraschino cherries to orzo. Combine juice from mandarin oranges, juice from pineapple chunks, juice from crushed pineapple, sugar, eggs, and flour in a saucepan over low heat; cook, stirring often, until sauce is thickened, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove sauce from heat and cool, about 30 minutes. Pour cooled sauce over orzo mixture and toss to coat. Refrigerate until flavors blend, 8 hours to overnight. Fold whipped topping into orzo mixture before serving.

Blend until smooth. Transfer to a bowl and add orange juice, vinegar, achiote powder, salt, cumin, lime zest, chile powder, and black pepper. Mix sauce well. Place pork in a slow cooker and cover with the sauce. Cover and cook on Low until pork is very tender, 7 to 9 hours. Begin heating tortillas 35 to 40 minutes before pork is done. Heat oil in a saucepan over high heat. Cook tortillas one at a time until brown spots appear, 30 seconds to 1 minute per side. Plate tortillas in stacks of two for each taco. Shred pork using 2 forks; mix to coat with the sauce. Scoop pork onto tacos using a slotted spoon. Top each with a portion of pineapple, cilantro, and onion.

Add the papaya and pound again, to bruise the ingredients. Stir in fish sauce, lime juice, and sugar and pound again. Ad the tomato and pound to combine. Stir in the chopped peanuts and serve. If you don't have a mortar and pestle, you can make a version of this in your blender or food processor: coarsely chop the garlic, chile peppers, and green beans. Mix in the papaya, and pulse a few times. Mix in the tomato, fish sauce, lime juice, and sugar. Pulse to combine; salad should still have texture. Transfer to a serving dish and stir in the peanuts.

Add the cilantro, lime juice, garlic, and hot chile paste. Toss to combine, then refrigerate until ready to serve. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate. Brush the tuna steaks with olive oil, then season with salt and pepper. Whisk the eggs in a shallow bowl until smooth. Dip the tuna steaks in the egg, and allow excess egg to run off.

Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan. Slice papayas in half lengthwise. Scoop out black seeds and discard. Peel and discard skin. Place flesh in a bowl and mash. Transfer to a strainer and allow to sit for 10 minutes to drain any liquid. Combine flour, poppy seeds, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Cream sugar and butter together in a separate bowl. Mix in eggs, one at a time, until well blended. Mix in papaya flesh, buttermilk, guava juice, and vanilla. Slowly stir in dry ingredients until just moistened. Pour into the prepared loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then release loaf from the pan onto a wire rack. Let cool completely, about 30 minutes, before slicing.

Reserve 2 tablespoons of seeds for the dressing. Peel and dice the papaya, and place in a medium bowl. Add tomatoes, red onion, red pepper and basil, and set aside. In a food processor or blender, combine the papaya seeds, sugar, wine vinegar, oil, mustard and green onions. Process until smooth and thick, and most of the seeds have broken up.

Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Lay a chicken breast flat onto your work surface. Use the tip of a sharp boning or paring knife to cut a pocket in the chicken breast through a 2 inch slit in the side. Repeat with the remaining chicken breasts. Place the slices into the pocket of each chicken breasts, then sprinkle papaya slices with cinnamon to taste. Dip the chicken breast halves one at a time into the melted margarine, then the cracker crumbs. Heat 1 tablespoons of margarine in a skillet over medium-high heat. Arrange the chicken breasts in the skillet and cook until golden brown on each side, about 10 minutes. Place browned chicken breasts on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for about 20 minutes, then flip each chicken breast. Continue baking until the chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Bring the rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Meanwhile, melt the remaining 1 tablespoon of margarine in the same skillet used to brown the chicken over medium-high heat, scraping up any browned bits. Stir in the orange juice, pineapple, brown sugar, 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, nutmeg, cayenne, salt and pepper. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until reduced, about 30 minutes. Reduce the heat once more to low and continue simmering until the sauce is thickened. Serve the chicken breasts over the rice with the pineapple sauce spooned on top.

Pulse until until the mixture is finely chopped, about 15 seconds. Place the ribs into a 9x13-inch glass baking dish and pour the marinade overtop. Mix the ribs around in the marinade to ensure they are evenly coated. Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 6 hours, or overnight for best results. Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Remove ribs from the marinade, and shake off excess. Scrape the marinade into a small saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 10 minutes; set aside. Bake the ribs in the preheated oven until the meat pulls away easily from the bone, about 1 1/2 hours.

Bring water to a boil in a medium pot; stir in rice. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl. Gently stir into cooked rice in the pot and set aside. Lay nori sheets on a baking sheet. Heat nori in the preheated oven until warm, 1 to 2 minutes. Center 1 nori sheet on a bamboo sushi mat. Use wet hands to spread a thin layer of rice on top. Arrange 1/4 of the crabmeat, avocado, cucumber, and pickled ginger over rice in a line down the center. Lift one end of the mat and roll it tightly over filling to make a complete roll.

Lay chicken breasts evenly onto a baking sheet. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon taco seasoning mix. Bake chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 30 to 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Allow to cool enough to handle, then shred or cut into strips. While chicken is cooking, warm oil in a stockpot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir onions and celery in hot oil until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in chicken broth and water; bring to a boil. Add remaining 1 tablespoon taco seasoning mix, cumin, and black pepper. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until flavors blend, about 30 minutes.

Crack eggs into a bowl, being careful to keep the yolks intact. Arrange avocado halves in a baking dish, resting them along the edge so avocado won't tip over. Gently spoon 1 egg yolk into the avocado hole. Continue spooning egg white into the hole until full. Repeat with remaining egg yolk, egg white, and avocado. Season each filled avocado with chives, parsley, sea salt, and pepper. Gently place baking dish in the preheated oven and bake until eggs are cooked, about 15 minutes.

Cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat, stir in vinegar and salt, and set aside to cool for at least 5 minutes. Cover a bamboo sushi mat with plastic wrap to keep rice from sticking. Place one nori sheet over the plastic. Spread rice evenly onto nori sheet, leaving about a 1/2 inch uncovered at the bottom. Arrange cucumber and avocado across the center of the rice. Lift the mat, roll over vegetables once, and press down. Unroll, then roll again towards the uncovered end of the nori to make a long roll. Seal roll with a little water if necessary. Repeat to make remaining rolls. Use a sharp, wet knife to slice each roll into 6 pieces.

Form the dough into 8 golf ball-sized balls. Cover and let rest, about 20 minutes. Stretch each ball of dough into a thick tortilla. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook each tortilla until browned and lightly puffed, about 1 minute per side. Layer refried beans, avocado, and queso fresco over tortillas.

Grease and flour two 9x5 inch loaf pans. Sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon and allspice. Set aside. In a medium bowl, cream together the sugar and butter until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then mix in the mashed avocado. Stir in the dry ingredients alternately with the buttermilk until just mixed. Fold in the chopped pecans, raisins and orange zest. Divide the batter evenly between the two loaf pans. Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean.

Scoop out some of the flesh in the center of each avocado; place into mixing bowl. Add chicken, cream cheese, tomatoes, salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper; mix well to combine. Scoop spoonfuls of chicken mixture into the wells of each avocado; top each with generous amount of Parmesan cheese. Place avocado halves, face-up, in muffin cups to stabilize. Bake avocados in preheated oven until cheese is melted, 8 to 10 minutes.

In a large skillet, brown the ground beef. Stir in the seasoning packet. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place a small amount of vegetable oil in a large skillet. Let the oil heat, then place one corn tortilla in the skillet. After 15 seconds, flip the tortilla over and let it fry another 15 seconds. Repeat this process with the remaining tortillas, letting them drain on paper towels once they have been heated. When the tortillas have drained, arrange them on a cookie sheet. Spread a thin layer of beans on the tortillas, followed by a layer of beef, and cheese. Bake the tortillas in the preheated oven for 20 to 30 minutes.

Squeeze the lime juice over the meat, and turn until evenly coated. Cover, and refrigerate for 30 minutes. In a blender or food processor, combine tomatillo and jalapeno. Puree for 15 to 20 seconds, or until thick. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Carefully pour in tomatillo mixture. Cook, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes. Stir in beef broth. Reduce heat, and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes, or until mixture coats a spoon. Transfer mixture to a serving dish. Heat tablespoon oil in a large skillet over high heat. Stir in 1/3 of the beef, and saute for 1 minute. Transfer to serving dish. Repeat with remaining beef. Meanwhile, heat tortillas in the oven or microwave, according to package instructions. To serve, place two tortillas on top of each other. Add desired amount of meat, spoon over some tomatillo mixture. Top with onions, tomatoes, avocado and cilantro. Garnish with a wedge of lemon, to be squeezed over taco before eating.

Drain rice and cook in a rice cooker with 2 cups of water. Rice must be slightly dry as vinegar will be added later. Immediately after rice is cooked, mix in 6 tablespoons rice vinegar to the hot rice. Spread rice on a plate until completely cool. Place 1 sheet of seaweed on bamboo mat, press a thin layer of cool rice on the seaweed. Leave at least 1/2 inch top and bottom edge of the seaweed uncovered. This is for easier sealing later. Dot some wasabi on the rice. Arrange cucumber, avocado and smoked salmon to the rice. Position them about 1 inch away from the bottom edge of the seaweed. Slightly wet the top edge of the seaweed.

Add chicken legs; return to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes, skimming away foam that forms on the surface. Add carrots, onion, celery, cilantro, garlic, and mint. Cover pot and cook until chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes more. Remove chicken from the pot; discard skin and bones. Shred meat using 2 forks. Return chicken meat to the pot and season with salt and pepper. Add rice. Let chicken and rice warm up, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and pour soup into serving bowls.

Bring to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer, and cover the pan. Allow the rice to simmer until the top looks dry, about 15 minutes. Turn off the heat, and let stand for 10 minutes to absorb the rest of the water. Mix the rice vinegar and sugar in a small bowl until the sugar has dissolved, and stir the mixture into the cooked rice until well combined. Allow the rice to cool, and set aside. Mix the imitation crabmeat with mayonnaise in a bowl, and set aside. To roll the sushi, cover a bamboo rolling mat with plastic wrap. Lay a sheet of nori, shiny side down, on the plastic wrap. With wet fingers, firmly pat a thin, even layer of prepared rice over the nori, leaving 1/4 inch uncovered at the bottom edge of the sheet. Sprinkle the rice with about 1/2 teaspoon of sesame seeds, and gently press them into the rice. Carefully flip the nori sheet over so the seaweed side is up. Place 2 or 3 long cucumber spears, 2 or 3 slices of avocado, and about 1 tablespoon of imitation crab mixture in a line across the nori sheet, about 1/4 from the uncovered edge. Pick up the edge of the bamboo rolling sheet, fold the bottom edge of the sheet up, enclosing the filling, and tightly roll the sushi into a cylinder about 1 1/2 inch in diameter. Once the sushi is rolled, wrap it in the mat and gently squeeze to compact it tightly. Cut each roll into 1 inch pieces with a very sharp knife dipped in water.

Let stand for about 5 minutes, or until shrimp are opaque. The lime juice will cook them. Mix in the tomatoes, onion, and cilantro until coated with lime juice; cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. Remove from the refrigerator, and mix in the Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, hot sauce, salt and pepper. We have our own hot sauce recipe, but you can use whatever hot sauce you like, or leave it out and let people add their own when serving. Serve in glass tumblers and top with avocado pieces. Set out extra Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, lime wedges and hot sauce for people to individualize their dish. Serve with saltine crackers.

Place one tortilla flat on the frying pan. After 1 minute flip the tortilla over. Sprinkle a little more than 1/4 cup cheese on the tortilla, followed by some olives, avocado, and hot pepper sauce. Place another tortilla on top to make a sandwich. Cover the quesadilla with a lid. After one minute, flip the quesadilla. When the cheese has melted on the inside, remove the quesadilla. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Cut the quesadillas into triangles and serve.

Crack eggs into the skillet side by side and cook until eggs are white on the bottom layer and firm enough to flip, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip eggs, trying not to crack the yolk, and cook until egg reaches desired doneness, 2 to 5 minutes more. Meanwhile, toast bread slices to desired doneness, 3 to 5 minutes.

Preheat a panini sandwich press. To make the sandwiches, split the ciabatta rolls in half the flat way, and brush the bottom of each roll with olive oil. Place the bottoms of the rolls onto the panini press, olive oil side down. Place a provolone cheese slice, half the spinach leaves, half the sliced turkey breast, and a sliced roasted red pepper on each sandwich. Spread half of the avocado mixture on the cut surface of each top, and place the top of the roll on the sandwich. Brush the top of the roll with olive oil. Close the panini press and cook until the bun is toasted and crisp, with golden brown grill marks, and the cheese has melted, about 5 to 8 minutes.

Pour in the lemon juice, sesame oil and soy sauce, and stir carefully to blend so as not to mash the avocado. Place this bowl into a larger bowl that has been filled with ice. Chill in the refrigerator for 15 minutes, but no longer - the terrific freshness of the fish will be lost. Once chilled, remove the bowl from the ice, and invert onto a serving plate. Serve with toasted bread or your favorite crackers.

Rub beef and chicken with fajita seasoning and 2 teaspoons garlic powder. Cut beef and chicken into 1-inch strips, and set aside. In a saucepan, warm refried beans over medium-low heat. Stir salt, lemon pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder into mashed avocados. Set aside. Heat corn oil in a deep skillet over medium-high heat. Cut tortillas in half, then cut in half again to make 4 triangular pieces per tortilla. Place into the skillet as many tortilla pieces as will fit without overlapping, and fry until crisp; repeat this process until all the tortilla pieces have been fried. Remove crisp tortillas to paper towels. Discard oil, and wipe out skillet. Return skillet to medium heat, and stir in beef, chicken, bell pepper, and onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, about 7 minutes; then stir in cilantro. Layer the tortilla pieces along the bottom of a large baking dish. Spread refried beans evenly over tortilla pieces. Sprinkle cheese over beans, then spread meat mixture evenly on top. Bake in preheated oven until cheese and beans are bubbly, about 20 minutes.

Boil until tomatillos turn bright green and soft, about 10 minutes. Place cilantro, avocados, cooked tomatillos, and cooked jalapenos into a blender, working in batches if necessary. Blend until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Add about 1 tablespoon of tomatillo cooking water, or as needed, if salsa is too thick. Stop the blender, and season the salsa with garlic powder and salt to taste. Blend again briefly to mix in the seasonings. Transfer to a bowl for serving.

Spread butter all over the pork tenderloin. Season with salt, pepper, and thyme. Combine garlic powder, apricot preserves, honey, and sherry in a separate bowl. Roast the pork in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the pork from the oven and brush with the apricot sauce. Return the pork to the oven. Continue roasting, basting occasionally with the remaining sauce, until the pork is no longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes.

Mix 2 1/2 cups of flour and the salt in a bowl; cut the shortening into the flour mixture with a pastry cutter until the mixture is crumbly. Using a fork, mix in water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough just holds together. Divide the dough in half and form each half into a ball. Working on a floured work surface, roll each ball out into a crust big enough for a 9-inch pie dish with an inch or so to spare. Carefully lift a crust, fold into quarters, position into pie dish, and unfold the crust. Set the other crust aside. Mix the sugar, 1/4 cup flour, and cinnamon together in a large bowl until thoroughly combined; stir in the lemon juice and apricots. Spoon the apricot filling over the pie crust in the dish, and top with the reserved crust. Crimp the edges of the crusts together with a fork, cut away the excess crust, and cut slits into the pie to allow steam to escape. Cover the edges of the pie crust with strips of aluminum foil to prevent burning. Bake on center rack of the preheated oven until the pie is browned and the filling is bubbling and thickened, 35 to 45 minutes. Remove to a rack to cool and sprinkle top with 1 teaspoon of sugar.

Place the ham cut side down onto a sheet of aluminum foil. I like to put the shiny side up. Mix together the brown sugar, apricot jam, and mustard powder in a small bowl. Brush onto the ham using a pastry or barbeque brush. Reserve any leftover glaze. Enclose the foil around the ham and place on a rimmed baking sheet.

Bring water, 3/4 cup sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, and nutmeg to a boil; stir until thickened, about 1 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and add apricots and 1 tablespoon butter. Simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes. Transfer mixture to a 9x13-inch baking dish. Combine flour, 1/4 cup sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Cut 7 tablespoons butter into flour mixture until mixture resembles a coarse crumb. Stir milk into crumbles until topping is just moistened. Spoon topping over apricot mixture. Sprinkle remaining 2 tablespoons sugar over topping. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes.

Season the pork chops with salt and pepper. Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium high heat. Add the pork chops and cook until brown on each side, and no longer pink in the center, about 4 minutes per side. Remove chops from the skillet. Reduce heat to medium low. Using the same skillet, pour in the apricot preserves mixture and simmer until thickened, about 4 minutes. Return pork chops to the skillet, turning to coat each side in the sauce; cook 1 minute.

Blend apricots, remaining water, and vanilla extract in a food processor, working in batches, until blended but still slightly chunky. Combine apricot mixture with pectin in a large pot over medium heat; cook until just boiling. Add sugar and lemon juice; boil until sugar has dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes. Sterilize jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack the apricot jam into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4-inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil, then carefully lower the jars into the pot using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary until the water level is at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a full boil, cover the pot, and process for 10 minutes. Remove jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool, about 1 hour. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area.

Slice the top off the half head of garlic with a sharp knife, exposing the cloves. Discard the top. Place the head of garlic on a piece of aluminum foil, drizzle with 1/4 teaspoon of olive oil, and wrap the foil around the garlic. Roast in the preheated oven until golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes. While garlic is roasting, place the onion and 1 tablespoon of olive oil into a saucepan over medium heat and cook and stir until the onion is browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in the apricot preserves, vinegar, ginger, cayenne pepper, and salt until thoroughly combined. Squeeze the roasted garlic cloves out of their skins, and mash them in a bowl with a spoon. Mix the garlic into the chutney; bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat and simmer until thickened, about 25 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir carefully because any splashes of chutney will be burning hot.

Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the lemon juice and lemon zest. Combine the flour and baking powder; stir into the cream cheese mixture until just combined. Cover, and chill until firm, about 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Roll tablespoonfuls of dough into balls, and place them 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets. Using your finger, make an indention in the center of each ball, and fill with 1/2 teaspoon of apricot preserves. Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until edges are golden. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheets for 2 minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely. Sprinkle with confectioner's sugar.

Measure out 1/2 cup spice mix and set remaining mix aside for another use. Make the tagine: Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Add apricots and raisins and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup cooking water. Place chicken and 1/2 cup reserved spice mix into a bowl; toss until thoroughly coated. Pour enough olive oil into a large skillet or Dutch oven to coat the bottom; turn heat to medium. Cook chicken in the hot skillet until golden brown and it releases easily from the skillet, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Add apricots, raisins, and reserved 1/2 cup cooking water; stir in chicken broth and honey. Cover, reduce the heat to low, and cook until chicken is very tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

Make the meatloaf: Combine ground beef, bread crumbs, onion, egg, garlic, apricot preserves, kosher salt, and pepper in a large mixing bowl; mix well until thoroughly combined. Transfer to a 9x5-inch loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Meanwhile, make the glaze: Mix ketchup, apricot preserves, brown sugar, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and cider vinegar together in a medium bowl. Remove meatloaf from the oven and pour glaze over top. Continue cooking until no longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes longer. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Let rest 5 minutes before serving.

Season the chicken drumsticks with salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Stir in garlic and red pepper flakes; cook and stir until garlic is softened and is fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Place the drumsticks in the skillet, and brown the chicken on all sides, about 3 minutes on each side. Transfer the skillet to the oven. Bake the chicken drumsticks in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 7 to 10 minutes. Bring the apricot nectar to a boil in a large pot over medium-high eat, then reduce heat to medium-low. Mix cornstarch and water together in a small bowl; stir cornstarch mixture and curry powder into the apricot nectar. Add dried apricots. Transfer the baked drumsticks into the apricot mixture. Heat the skillet used to cook the chicken over medium heat. Stir in the onion, green bell pepper, carrots, and green chile pepper; cook and stir until the onion has softened. Pour the drumsticks and apricot sauce into the skillet. Cover and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

Combine lemon juice, apricots, and sugar in a saucepan. Cook over medium heat until sugar has dissolved. Transfer to a blender and puree until smooth. Cover an 11x17-inch pan or cookie sheet with a layer of plastic wrap. Pour pureed fruit onto the prepared pan and spread evenly to within 1 inch of the edge. Bake for 4 to 6 hours in the preheated oven, using a spoon or a pair of tongs to keep the door slightly ajar, or until puree has dried and is no longer sticky. Once dry, you can cut it into strips; store in an airtight container.

Remove from food processor and pour in a bowl. Place the remaining almonds and sunflower seeds into the food processor; roughly chop into larger pieces, about 1 minute. Mix remaining nuts, seeds, shredded coconut, and dried apricot into the 1/4-inch nuts until fruit and nut mixture is combined. Combine coconut oil, honey, ground cinnamon, vanilla extract, and salt in a sauce pan over medium-low heat; cook until the coconut oil mixture bubbles and turns a lighter color, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour coconut oil mixture over the fruit and nut mixture; stir until the granola mixture takes on the consistency of wet sand, about 1 minute. Line a baking sheet with waxed paper. Pour granola mixture onto the sheet; place a second sheet of waxed paper on top of the granola mixture. Push down on the waxed paper with you hands until the granola mixture has been evenly spread.

Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat, and brown the chops well on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Stir in honey, apricots, and garlic; cover, and simmer until the pork is tender, about 8 minutes. An instant-read thermometer, inserted into the center of a chop, should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Sprinkle with parsley, and serve chops topped with the apricots and pan juices.

Cream the butter and sugar in a medium size mixing bowl. Mix flour, baking powder, salt, egg and vanilla extract into the butter-sugar mixture. Cool dough in the refrigerator for 1 hour. On a lightly floured surface roll dough out to 1/4 inch thick. Cut the dough into rounds with a round cookie cutter or glass. Using the tip of a teaspoon place a small drop of apricot preserves into the middle of the circle. Brush edges with water and fold the dough over so that the cookie is in the shape of a half moon; seal edges Arrange on ungreased cookie sheets. Bake for 8 to 12 minutes, or until golden brown.

Grease a 12 cup muffin pan, or line with paper muffin cups. Place apricots into a small bowl, and pour the boiling water over them. Let stand for 5 minutes. In a medium bowl stir together the flour, sugar, baking soda and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together the melted butter, oil, buttermilk and egg. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, and stir until just blended. It is okay for the batter to have some lumps. Drain water from apricots, and mix them into the batter.

In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the sour cream and flavorings mixture, stirring just until incorporated. Pour batter into prepared pan.

Heat oil in a large Dutch oven or tagine over medium heat. Add onions; cook, stirring occasionally until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, ginger, and cinnamon; cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add seasoned lamb; cook, stirring frequently until light brown, being careful not to caramelize, about 2 minutes. Add chicken stock and bring to a gentle boil over medium heat. Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, until the lamb is just tender, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Stir in apricots, orange peels, and honey; continue to simmer over low heat, uncovered, until the liquid has thickened slightly and lamb is fork-tender, about 30 minutes. Remove from the heat, discard cinnamon sticks and orange peels. Divide evenly among 4 bowls. Garnish each bowl with a tablespoon each of cilantro and pine nuts.

Bring apricot mixture to a rolling boil, stirring constantly. Quickly stir in pectin; return to a full boil until pectin is dissolved, 1 minute. Remove from heat and skim off any foam with a metal spoon. Sterilize jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack apricot jam into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil, then carefully lower the jars into the pot using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary until the water level is at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a full boil, cover the pot, and process for 5 minutes. Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, for at least 24 hours. Press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). It may take up to 2 weeks for jam to set. Store in a cool, dark area.

Whisk together apricot preserves, soy sauce, brown sugar, and garlic powder until blended. Pour apricot marinade over ribs, cover, and place in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking pan with aluminum foil. Remove ribs from the marinade and shake off excess. Place ribs in the prepared baking pan and season with salt and pepper. Pour marinade into a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer marinade for 5 minutes; set aside. Bake ribs in the preheated oven, basting frequently with the cooked marinade, until ribs are tender and meat pulls away easily from the bone, about 1 hour 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

Season the chicken with salt and pepper, and cook in the hot oil until golden brown around the edges, but still pink in the center, about 5 minutes. Stir in the onion, and cook for about 3 minutes more. Pour in the balsamic vinegar, bring it to a simmer, and allow it to reduce for a few minutes. Cut half of the apricots in half, leaving the others whole. Place the apricots into the skillet, and pour in the chicken stock. Bring to a simmer, then stir in the apricot preserves and thyme. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the apricots have softened, 10 to 15 minutes. Sprinkle with chopped parsley to serve.

Line a 9-inch springform pan with parchment paper. Combine almond flour, brown sugar, and almonds in a bowl. Add melted butter; stir with a fork until the mixture resembles wet sand. Spread on the bottom of the parchment-lined pan. Combine apricots and water in a saucepan; bring to a boil and simmer until very soft, about 10 minutes. Drain; mash apricots into a pulp. Add amaretto; mix well. Sweeten with 1 teaspoon white sugar. Beat cream cheese, 3/4 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup sour cream, cornstarch, and 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract in a bowl using an electric mixer on low speed. Add eggs one at a time; mix well. Fold in 2 tablespoons of apricot pulp; reserve remainder for topping. Pour cheesecake batter into the pan, covering the crust. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are puffed and surface of cheesecake is firm except for a small spot in the center that will jiggle when the pan is gently shaken, about 45 minutes. Beat 1 1/2 cups sour cream, 3 tablespoons white sugar, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract together until combined. Remove cheesecake from the hot oven; spoon topping over the surface and return cake to the oven for 8 minutes more. Cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. Refrigerate for 6 to 8 hours. Top with remaining apricot pulp.

Lightly grease a 9x9 inch baking pan. Bring a large saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil. Stir in egg noodles, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. In a medium bowl, thoroughly mix egg noodles with 1/4 cup butter, cream cheese, eggs, 1/2 cup sugar, and vanilla. Stir in apricot nectar and milk. Mix in raisins. Transfer to the prepared baking pan. In a separate medium bowl, mix cornflake crumbs, 1/2 cup butter, 1/4 cup sugar, remaining vanilla, and cinnamon. Spread over the egg noodle mixture. Bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until bubbly and lightly browned.

Cook the fruit uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the fruit is tender, about 15 minutes. Drain fruit in a colander and mash together in a bowl using a fork. Set aside. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk eggs, 1 cup sugar, oil, lemon zest, and orange zest together in a bowl and set aside. Sift flour and baking powder together in a large bowl. Stir in the egg mixture, kneading with hands until the dough comes together. Roll out dough to about 1/4 inch in thickness on a lightly floured surface. Cut circles out using a cookie cutter or the rim of a drinking glass. Mix prune and apricot mixture, lemon juice, walnuts, and 1/3 cup sugar in a bowl. Place a tablespoon of the filling in the center of the cookie. Pinch the edges firmly together to create a triangle, leaving the center open to expose the filling. Repeat with the remaining cookies. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.

Apricot and Cranberry Stuffed Roast Pork Loin With Port Wine Pan Sauce                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 250 degrees. Heat oil in a small skillet over medium-low heat. Add whole garlic cloves and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and golden, about 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon; reserve oil. Turn pork loin fat-side down. Slit lengthwise, almost but not quite all the way through, to form a long pocket, leaving a 1/2-inch border of unslit meat at each end. Brush cavity with some of the reserved garlic cooking oil, and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper and 1 Tb. of the rosemary. Line cavity with sauteed garlic and apricots; sprinkle in cranberries. Tie loin together with kitchen twine or heavy-duty string at 1 1/2-inch intervals. Brush with remaining oil, and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Set roast, fat-side up, diagonally or curved (so it fits) on a large, lipped cookie sheet or jellyroll pan. Warm 1/4 cup apple jelly along with the minced garlic and remaining rosemary. Brush mixture onto meat. Roast until a meat thermometer stuck into the center registers 125 to 130 degrees. (Start checking at about 1 1/2 hours.) Remove from oven; raise oven temperature to 400 degrees. Brush loin with pan drippings, return to oven, and continue to roast until the loin is golden brown and a meat thermometer stuck into the center registers 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), about 20 minutes longer. For even more attractive coloring, broil until spotty brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Let roast rest 15 to 20 minutes; transfer to a carving board. Stir juices around pan to loosen brown bits. Pour through a strainer into a small pan, and stir in port, chicken broth and remaining 2 Tbs. of jelly; bring to a simmer.

Grease an 11x17 inch jelly roll pan. Mix together the walnuts, ground cinnamon, and 3/4 cup of sugar in a medium bowl and set aside. In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. In a large bowl, stir together the yeast mixture, egg yolks, sour cream, and butter. Gradually stir in the flour until the dough becomes too stiff to use a spoon. Use your hand to knead the dough in the bowl until it becomes smooth, about 5 minutes. Divide the dough into three equal parts, form into balls, cover, and set aside to rest for about 15 minutes. Roll one of the balls of dough between 2 sheets of waxed paper to fit the pan. Place the dough in the bottom of the prepared baking pan and spread with 3/4 of the nut mixture. Roll out another ball of dough in the same way, place this over the nut layer in the pan and spread the apricot preserves evenly over the dough. Roll the third ball in the same way and place on top of the layer of preserves. Place the torte in the preheated oven and set the timer for 40 minutes. When the timer goes off, the top of the torte should be golden brown, if not then wait a few minutes. Place the egg whites into a clean glass or metal bowl. Whip the egg whites to soft peaks, then gradually add 2/3 cup sugar while beating the egg whites to stiff peaks. Spread the meringue evenly over the top of the torte and sprinkle with the remaining nut mixture. Bake the meringue-covered torte for an additional 15 minutes. Cool the torte in the pan set on a wire rack. Trim the edges for a cleaner presentation. Serve at room temperature.

Grease a 9x13-inch cake pan and add 1/2 of the toasted bread. Sprinkle 1/2 of the Monterey Jack cheese, walnuts, raisins, and apricots over the bread. Drizzle 1/2 of the syrup on top to fully coat the bread. Top with the remaining bread, cheese, walnuts, raisins, apricots, and syrup. Cover with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove foil and continue baking until lightly browned and heated through, about 15 minutes more. Serve warm.

  Ma Lipo's Apricot-Glazed Turkey with Roasted Onion and Shallot Gravy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Combine apricot nectar, preserves, ginger, and honey in a small saucepan and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until thickened and reduced to 1-1/4 cups, about 15 minutes. Blend 3/4 cup unsalted butter at room temperature, 3 tablespoons chopped fresh sage, salt, and pepper in small bowl. Set aside. Melt 2 tablespoons unsalted butter in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Add onions and shallots; saute until very soft and light brown, about 20 minutes. Position rack in lowest third of oven. Preheat to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Season turkey cavity with salt and pepper. Place turkey, breast side up, on a rack in a large roasting pan. Slide hand under skin of turkey breast to loosen skin. Spread half of herb butter over breast under skin. Rub remaining herb butter over outside of turkey. If stuffing turkey, spoon stuffing loosely into main cavity; it will expand as it cooks. Tie legs together loosely to hold shape of turkey. Roast turkey for 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C), and continue roasting 1 hour 30 minutes, basting occasionally with pan drippings. Tent turkey with aluminum foil; roast 45 minutes longer. Add onion mixture, 1 cup broth, thyme, and 1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh sage to the roasting pan. Roast 15 more minutes before brushing 1/2 cup apricot glaze over turkey. Continue to roast turkey uncovered, brushing occasionally with glaze. Add more broth to the pan if necessary. Bake 40 minutes longer for unstuffed turkey, and 1 hour 10 minutes longer for stuffed turkey, or until meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 165 degrees F (75 degrees C). Place turkey on a platter, and tent with foil. Let stand 30 minutes. Reserve mixture in pan for gravy. Pour contents of roasting pan into a strainer set over a large bowl. Skim fat from pan juices using a large spoon. Transfer the onion mixture to a blender. Add 1 cup pan juices, and puree until smooth, adding more pan juices and chicken broth if necessary to thin sauce to desired consistency. Transfer sauce to a large saucepan, and bring to a boil.

Score the fatty side of the ham with a sharp knife in a diamond pattern, spacing the lines about 1 inch apart. Insert whole cloves at the intersections, if desired. Place the ham in a shallow roasting pan and cover with aluminum foil. Bake the ham in the preheated oven for about 90 minutes. About 10 minutes before the ham is finished, measure the apricot preserves into a small saucepan. Warm over medium heat until liquid, then remove from the heat and stir in the honey mustard. Brush the glaze onto the ham, and return to the oven, uncovered, and bake for an additional 15 to 20 minutes, or until the glaze is nicely browned. Let the ham stand for about 10 minutes before carving and serving.

Arrange the chicken pieces in a single layer in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Bake uncovered for 25 to 30 minutes, or until no longer pink in the center, and juices run clear. While the chicken is cooking, stir together the apricot preserves, sour cream, mustard, salt and pepper in a small bowl. When the chicken is done, remove from the oven, and coat with the sauce.

Add pork chops, cover, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or up to 4 hours. Remove pork chops from the brine and shake off excess. Discard the remaining brine. Pat chops dry with paper towels and place on a plate or cutting board. Combine chili powder, onion powder, salt, and white pepper in a small bowl. Distribute 1/2 of the rub mixture among the 4 chops and rub to coat the entire surface. Turn the chops and repeat. Allow chops to come to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, combine apricot all-fruit spread, hoisin sauce, ginger, garlic, chili-garlic sauce, and lime juice for the glaze in a medium, microwave-safe bowl. Microwave mixture on high for 3 minutes, stirring halfway through. Carefully remove glaze and set aside. Preheat air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) if recommended by manufacturer. Spray each side of seasoned and rubbed chops with cooking spray. Place chops in the air fryer in a single layer and air-fry for 8 minutes, turning halfway through. Brush the tops of the chops with prepared glaze and air-fry until pork chops are no longer pink in the center, 2 to 3 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Sprinkle chops with minced parsley, and serve with remaining glaze.

Immerse in simmering water until jam is ready. Wash new, unused lids and rings in warm soapy water. Finely chop apricots and measure; you should have 5 cups prepared fruit. Transfer apricots to a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in pectin and slowly bring mixture to a full rolling boil. Add sugar and stir to dissolve. Return to a full rolling boil over high heat and boil for exactly 1 minute, stirring constantly. Skim off any foam with a ladle or a large spoon. Remove from heat and stir in the apricot brandy. Pack apricot jam into the prepared jars, filling to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a clean knife or thin spatula around the insides of the jars to remove any air bubbles. Wipe rims with a moist paper towel to remove any spills. Top with lids and tightly screw on rings. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars 2 inches apart into the boiling water using a holder. Pour in more boiling water to cover jars by at least 1 inch. Bring to a rolling boil, cover, and process for 10 minutes. Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart. Let rest for 24 hours without moving the jars. Gently press the center of each lid with a finger to ensure the lid does not move up or down. Remove the rings for storage and store in a cool, dark area.

Grease a cookie sheet or line it with parchment paper. Cream together butter and sugar in a bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs and vanilla. Sift together the flour, cinnamon, and baking powder in a separate bowl. Mix dry ingredients into the egg mixture. Stir in the espresso powder, orange zest, chocolate chips, dried apricots, dried cranberries and almonds. Shape dough into two equal logs approximately 12 inches long by 2 inches diameter. Place logs on baking sheet, and flatten out to about 1 inch thickness. Brush the log with egg wash. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden and the center is firm, about 35 to 40 minutes. Remove from oven to cool on the pans. When loaves are cool enough to handle, use a serrated knife to slice the loaves diagonally into 1/2 inch thick slices. Return the slices to the baking sheet. Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Bake until they start turning light brown, 15 to 20 minutes.

Immerse the jars and rings in simmering water until jam is ready. Wash new, unused lids and rings in warm soapy water. Measure finely chopped, peeled nectarines; you should have 4 1/2 cups. Add to a heavy pot and immediately mix with lemon juice so they don't turn brown. Combine 1/4 cup sugar and fruit pectin in a small bowl. Add to nectarines in the pot; stir well. Slowly bring mixture to a full rolling boil that does not stop bubbling when stirred. Add remaining 2 3/4 cups sugar and stir to dissolve, making sure to scrape over the bottom of the pot. Boil for exactly 1 minute, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and stir in almond extract. Pack jam into the prepared jars, filling to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a clean knife or thin spatula around the insides of the jars to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims with a moist paper towel to remove any spills. Top with the lids and tightly screw on the rings. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars 2 inches apart into the boiling water using a holder. Pour in more boiling water to cover jars by at least 1 inch. Bring to a rolling boil, cover, and process for 10 minutes. Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart. Let rest for 24 hours without moving the jars. Gently press the center of each lid with a finger to ensure the lid does not move up or down.

Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer, stirring frequently, until the sugar dissolves completely, about 8 minutes. Set aside to cool. Mix nectarines, cherries, strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries in a large bowl. Pour the cooled sugar mixture over the fruit and toss gently to coat. Beat heavy whipping cream and 2 teaspoons sugar in a bowl with an electric hand mixer on high until stiff peaks form. Fold 1 teaspoon raspberry-flavored liqueur into the whipped cream; spoon over the fruit salad and sprinkle evenly with almonds.

Set vinaigrette aside. Toss 1/2 of the vinaigrette together with spinach, nectarine, almonds, red onion, and bell pepper in a large bowl. Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add strips of halloumi and let cook until the undersides are golden brown and all liquid has been released and evaporates, about 4 minutes.

Lightly oil grate, and set 4 inches from the heat. To make the salsa, place the nectarines, tomato, onion, cilantro, lime juice, and red pepper flakes in a bowl; toss to blend. Season to taste with salt. Cover, and refrigerate 30 minutes to blend flavors. Stir the cumin, chili powder, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl. Place the olive oil in a small bowl. Brush the pork chops with oil, and season both sides evenly with the cumin mixture. Place pork loin chops on the preheated grill. Cook until lightly browned and juices run clear, about 4 minutes on each side. Place pork chops on serving plates, and top with a generous spoonful of salsa.

Grease a 9-inch baking pan. Boil peaches and nectarines 1 fruit at a time in a pot until very soft, about 30 seconds each. Let cool until ready to handle. Peel, core, and chop into bite-sized pieces. Mix the fruit, sugar, cornstarch, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl. Pour into the prepared pan. Combine flour, brown sugar, coconut oil, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a bowl. Mix with hands or a fork until crumbly. Sprinkle evenly over the fruit mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until top is browned and juice appears bubbly, about 30 minutes. Let cool for at least 15 minutes before serving.

Place butter in a 9-inch round cake pan and melt in the oven as it preheats. Remove pan from oven and sprinkle brown sugar evenly over melted butter. Arrange nectarine pieces on the brown sugar layer. Gently whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Beat unsalted butter and white sugar together in a separate bowl until creamy and smooth; add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat vanilla extract into the creamed butter mixture. Add flour mixture to creamed butter mixture; beat on low speed just until batter is combined, about 1 minute. Spread batter over nectarine layer. Increase oven temperature to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Bake in the preheated oven until cake is golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes.

Drizzle 1 teaspoon olive oil onto a small plate. Place nectarine wedges on the plate and cover all sides with oil. Brush both sides of bread with 2 tablespoons olive oil. Place nectarines onto the hot grate and grill 1 to 2 minutes per side; remove to a plate. When nectarine wedges have cooled slightly, cut each wedge in 1/2 lengthwise so you now have 16 pieces. Place bread slices onto the hot grate and cook until grill marks appear and bread is toasted, about 1 minute per side; remove to a plate. Spread ricotta cheese onto each slice of toast. Arrange 8 nectarine slices onto each toast and top with almonds. Sprinkle with mint and drizzle with honey. Cut each toast in half and serve.

Grease a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate. Combine apple peels, white sugar, brown sugar, water, brandy, cinnamon, and vanilla extract in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and simmer until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Remove apple peels with a fork. Roll 1 crust into a 12-inch circle; place in the prepared pie plate. Roll out second crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut a few slits in the center to vent steam. Mix corn muffin mix and milk in a bowl. Pour into pie plate. Bake in the preheated oven for 5 to 8 minutes. Remove from oven. Layer apple slices and nectarine slices on top. Pour sugar mixture slowly over fruit; cover with second crust. Press crusts together to seal; flute edges. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking until top crust is golden brown, 35 to 45 minutes.

Season flour lightly with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. Cut chicken breasts into 1/2-inch strips. Dredge chicken pieces in the seasoned flour; sprinkle more salt and pepper on top. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken strips and brown on both sides, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Pour in the orange sauce. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until sauce thickens and chicken is no longer pink in the centers, 8 to 10 minutes. Plate the chicken and top with nectarine slices.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Submerge nectarines for about 30 seconds. Remove with a slotted spoon and let cool until safe to handle. Peel, halve, remove pit, and slice. Combine sliced nectarines, raspberries, and white sugar in a bowl. Transfer to a baking dish. Combine brown sugar, butter, flour, oats, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt in a bowl.

Combine flour and 1/2 cup sugar in a 9x13-inch baking pan; cut in butter until mixture is crumbly. Press firmly into an even layer. Bake in preheated oven until crust is slightly browned, about 25 minutes. Place 1/3 of the nectarine slices in a blender and puree until smooth. Stir cornstarch into the mixture until evenly distributed. Beat eggs in a large bowl until light, using an electric mixer; gradually beat in 1 cup sugar until well combined. Stir in the blended nectarine mixture; pour over hot baked crust. Bake until almost set, about 30 minutes. Let cool completely on a rack, 30 minutes to 1 hour; cut into bars. Top bars with remaining nectarine slices.

Place cherries, nectarines and apricots into a colander to drain off any excess liquid. To Make Dough: In a medium bowl, combine flour and salt. Cut 3/4 cup of butter into flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. Pour in one tablespoon of water at a time until the dough sticks together. Add additional water if necessary. Divide dough into two parts. Roll out one half toa circle 1/8 of an inch thick, then place in a 9 inch pie pan. Roll out the other half of the dough and cut into long strips about 1/2 inch wide. Set aside. To Make Filling: Place the drained fruit mixture into a medium bowl, Stir in the sugar, cinnamon, cornstarch and flour; pour into the prepared pie pan. Dot with the remaining two tablespoons of butter. Arrange the pastry strips into a lattice top and crimp edges. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolk and teaspoon of water, and use a pastry brush to coat just the lattice strips--not the edges. Bake in the preheated oven and bake for 25 minutes, until the crust begins to brown. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake for an additional 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool a bit before serving.

Spread the nectarine and plum pieces into the bottom of a 13x9-inch baking dish. Sprinkle the raspberries over the fruit. Whisk together the flour, white sugar, brown sugar, ginger, and cinnamon in a bowl; cut the butter into the flour mixture with a pastry cutter until it resembles coarse crumbs. Spread the crumb mixture evenly over the fruit and raspberries. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, and turn the dish around in the oven for even cooking.

Grease a 9-inch springform pan. Beat butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Add sugar and salt gradually and mix in well. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Combine flour and baking powder, sift, and quickly beat into the batter on low speed. Thin batter with a little milk if needed. Pour batter into the prepared springform pan. Arrange nectarines and blackberries on top in a decorative pattern. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Dust with confectioners' sugar and cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack. Let cool completely.

Stir occasionally until melted and smooth. Beat in egg and stir until thick, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and mix in graham cracker crumbs, coconut, and almonds. Press into the bottom of an ungreased 8x8-inch pan. For the middle layer, beat remaining 1/2 cup softened butter, heavy cream, and custard powder until light and fluffy. Mix in confectioners' sugar until smooth. Spread over the bottom layer in the pan. Chill to set. While the second layer is chilling, melt semisweet chocolate and 2 teaspoons butter together in the microwave or over low heat. Spread melted chocolate mixture over chilled bars. Let the chocolate set before cutting into squares.

Whisk together 1/2 cup flour, beer, egg, and baking powder in a medium bowl until smooth. Place coconut and remaining 1/4 cup flour in 2 separate bowls. One at a time, hold shrimp by the tail and dredge in flour, shaking off excess. Dip in beer batter; allow excess to drip off. Roll in coconut, then place on the prepared baking sheet. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Heat oil in a deep fryer or large skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Working in batches, fry shrimp in hot oil, turning once, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Use tongs to remove shrimp to paper towels to drain. jenniwun                                                          Total Fat 118g 151%, Saturated Fat 21g 105%, Cholesterol 31mg 10%, Sodium 205mg 9%, Total Carbohydrate 26g 9%, Dietary Fiber 3g 10%, Protein 4g, Calcium 78mg 6%, Iron 1mg 8%, Potassium 125mg 3%

Grease three 9-inch round cake pans. Make the cake: Combine buttermilk and baking soda together in a small bowl; set aside. Beat butter, shortening, and sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Mix in eggs, buttermilk mixture, vanilla, coconut, baking powder, and flour; stir until just combined. Pour batter into the prepared pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool in the pans for 5 minutes; transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely, 20 to 25 minutes. Make the frosting (while cakes are cooling): Beat cream cheese, butter, vanilla, and confectioners' sugar in a medium bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in cream, a little at a time, to attain the desired consistency. Stir in walnuts and coconut. Spread frosting between the cake layers and on the top and sides of cooled cake.

Lightly beat eggs in a second shallow dish. Stir together coconut and panko in a third shallow dish. Working one at a time, dredge shrimp in flour mixture; shake off excess. Dip floured shrimp in egg; allow any excess to drip off. Finally, dredge in coconut mixture, pressing to adhere. Place shrimp on a plate. Coat shrimp well with cooking spray. Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place 1/2 of the shrimp in the air fryer and cook about 3 minutes. Turn shrimp over and continue cooking until golden, about 3 minutes more. Season with 1/4 teaspoon salt. Repeat with remaining shrimp. Meanwhile, whisk together honey, lime juice, and serrano chile in a small bowl. Sprinkle fried shrimp with cilantro and serve with honey-lime dip.

Grease a 10-inch tube pan. Combine flour and baking powder in a medium bowl; set aside. Combine milk and extracts in a liquid measure; set aside. Cream sugar, butter, and shortening in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in flour mixture alternately with milk mixture in batches, beginning and ending with flour mixture. Spoon mixture into the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 hours. Cool in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes. While cake is cooling, make glaze: Combine sugar, water, and extracts in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Turn cake out onto the wire rack. Place waxed paper under the rack to catch glaze drippings. Slowly spoon glaze over the top of hot cake. Cool completely.

Cook and stir until fragrant and lightly browned. Remove ginger and set aside. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Place chicken in the same skillet over medium-high heat without crowding. Cook until chicken is lightly brown on all sides. Return ginger to the skillet and add coconut milk. Bring to a boil, then cover with the lid tilted to allow steam to escape. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until chicken is no longer pink at the bone, about 30 minutes.

Cook, stirring constantly, until oil begins to separate from the milk, about 30 minutes. Skim and reserve oil in a bowl. Reduce the heat to medium-low and add sugar; continue to cook and stir until milk becomes brown and crumbly, about 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool. Grease an 8-inch mold or pie pan with reserved coconut oil. Make the pudding: Heat coconut milk, cream-style corn, cornstarch, sugar, and corn kernels in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Pour corn mixture into the prepared mold. Cool for 30 minutes, then refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour. Invert pudding carefully onto a serving plate and cut into 12 slices.

Grease a 9-inch square baking dish. Spread oats and coconut evenly across a baking sheet. Toast oats and coconut in the preheated oven until browned, about 10 minutes; transfer to a large mixing bowl. Mix honey, peanut butter, vanilla, and salt in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook and stir until smooth. Pour honey mixture over oats and coconut. Stir to coat. Spread mixture evenly into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until beginning to dry, about 15 minutes for crunchy granola bars, less if you like them chewy.

Unroll the puff pastry sheets, and place flat on a baking sheet. Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until puffed and golden brown. Break the puff pastry into pieces, and place in a large bowl. Add the raisins, almonds, pine nuts, pistachios, and coconut, and toss to distribute. Pour into a 9x13 inch glass baking dish, and spread evenly. Pour the milk into a saucepan, and stir in the sugar and vanilla. Heat until hot but not quite boiling. Pour over the mixture in the baking dish. Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Turn the oven to broil, and broil for 2 minutes to brown the top. Remove from the oven and let stand for 5 minutes. Serve warm.

Grease and flour an 8x12-inch pan. Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside. Beat 1/2 cup butter and 3/4 cup sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. The mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Add the room-temperature eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next. Beat in the vanilla with the last egg. Pour in the flour mixture alternately with the milk, mixing until just incorporated. Pour batter into the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely. Wrap with plastic wrap and store overnight at room temperature to give the cake a chance to firm up before slicing. To make the icing: In a large bowl, combine confectioners' sugar and cocoa. Add the melted butter and warm milk and mix well to create a fluid, but not too runny, icing. Cut the cake into 24 squares. Place parchment paper or waxed paper on a work surface, and set a wire rack on the paper. Pour the shredded coconut into a shallow bowl.

Dissolve sugar into the liquid. Bring the mixture to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, place a cover on the saucepan, and simmer until the majority of the liquid has been absorbed by the rice, 15 to 20 minutes.

Place 1 cup of the sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook gently, without stirring, but shaking occasionally until the sugar has melted. Continue cooking until the sugar has completely melted, and turned golden brown. Pour into a large, glass baking dish. Spread the caramel evenly over the bottom of the dish, then set aside to cool for 15 minutes before proceeding. Once the caramel has hardened, pour the condensed milk, evaporated milk, milk, eggs, 1/2 cup sugar, and coconut into a blender. Blend for 3 minutes until smooth. Pour into baking dish over the caramel. Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes until set. When done, remove from oven and let cool for 30 minutes.

Grease a 9x13-inch cake pan. Beat sugar, butter, and egg yolks together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy; add shredded coconut. Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Stir creamed butter mixture, alternating with coconut milk, into flour mixture until batter is just mixed. Beat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until until soft peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form soft mounds rather than a sharp peak. Fold egg whites into batter. Pour batter into the prepared cake pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 45 minutes.

Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, about 20 minutes. Combine rice, coconut milk, sugar, and salt in a large saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until pudding is thick and creamy, 18 to 20 minutes. Stir milk and eggs into pudding, stirring constantly to keep pudding from sticking, at least 2 minutes. Remove pudding from heat and stir in butter, vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg until thoroughly mixed. Fold peaches and raisins into pudding; serve warm.

In a large bowl, beat 1 cup of softened margarine with 2 cups of sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Stir in 4 egg yolks, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and the chocolate-water mixture until thoroughly blended. Sift the flour, baking soda, and salt into a bowl. Beat the flour mixture into the liquid ingredients, alternating with buttermilk, in 3 or 4 additions. Beat until batter is smooth, about 1 minute. In a metal or glass bowl, beat the reserved egg whites until they hold stiff peaks when the beaters are lifted straight up. Gently fold the beaten egg whites into the batter, keeping as much volume as possible. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pans. Bake in the preheated oven until the cakes have browned lightly and a toothpick inserted into the center of a cake comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Allow the cakes to cool in pans before removing. To make frosting, pour the evaporated milk into a large saucepan, and mix in 1 cup of sugar, 3 egg yolks, 1/4 cup of margarine, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium, and cook until thickened, stirring constantly, about 12 minutes. Remove from heat, and mix in the coconut and pecans, beating the frosting until cooled and spreadable. Frost and fill the cake with the coconut frosting.

In a large bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Add butter, and cut in using a pastry blender or a fork until the mixture resembles fine crumbs. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, vanilla extract, and almond extract. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients, and pour in the wet ingredients. Add coconut, and mix just enough to blend. Drop by rounded tablespoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets. Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden brown.

Gradually add the confectioners' sugar, one cup at a time, alternating with heavy cream. Beat in the salt, coconut flavoring, and vanilla extract. Continue beating until mixture is smooth and spreadable. Add additional confectioners' sugar if necessary to thicken the frosting, or more cream to thin. Stir in the coconut. If desired, spoon toasted coconut evenly over frosted cake.

Combine mashed strawberries, sugar, and lemon juice in a heavy-bottomed saucepan; stir over low heat until sugar is dissolved. Increase heat to high, and bring the mixture to a full rolling boil. Continue to boil, stirring often, until the mixture reaches 220 degrees F (105 degrees C). Check doneness after 10 to 15 minutes by dropping a small spoonful of jam onto a frozen plate. Let sit for 1 to 2 minutes; if jam appears to gel, it is ready. Continue cooking if jam appears thin and runny. Transfer jam into hot sterile jars, filling to within 1/4 inch of the top. Top with lids and screw rings on tightly. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill it halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars 2 inches apart into the boiling water using a holder. Pour in more boiling water to cover jars by at least 1 inch. Bring to a rolling boil, cover, and process for 10 minutes. Remove the jars from the stockpot and let rest, several inches apart, for 12 to 24 hours. Store in a cool, dark area.

Mix sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl; sprinkle over blueberries. Line a pie dish with one pie crust. Pour berry mixture into the crust and dot with butter. Cut remaining pastry into 1/2- to 3/4-inch-wide strips. Use the strips to weave a lattice top. Crimp and flute the edges. Bake pie on the lowest oven rack until filling is bubbling and crust is golden brown, about 50 minutes. justamom                          Total Fat 17g 21%, Saturated Fat 5g 24%, Cholesterol 4mg 1%, Sodium 318mg 14%, Total Carbohydrate 53g 19%, Dietary Fiber 4g 13%, Total Sugars 26g, Protein 3g, Vitamin C 7mg 35%, Calcium 11mg 1%, Iron 2mg 8%, Potassium 86mg 2%

Cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture sizzles and juice begins to form. Continue stirring; mash a few strawberries with a wooden spoon or heat-proof spatula to help produce the syrup. Cook until sauce thickens, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat. Transfer 1/3 of the strawberry sauce to a blender. Cover and hold the lid down with a potholder while you puree the mixture.

Combine 3 1/2 cups of blackberries with 1/2 cup sugar and flour in a large bowl. Spoon mixture into the unbaked pie crust. Spread remaining 1/2 cup berries on top of sweetened berries, and cover with the top crust. Seal and crimp the edges, and cut vents in the top crust for steam to escape. Brush the top crust with milk and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup sugar. Bake pie in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the temperature of the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and bake until filling is bubbly and crust is golden brown, an additional 20 to 25 minutes. Cool on wire rack.

Arrange 1/2 of the bread cubes in the dish and top with cream cheese cubes. Sprinkle blueberries over the cream cheese, then top with remaining bread cubes. Whisk eggs, milk, vanilla extract, and syrup together in a large bowl until well-combined; pour over the bread cubes. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Remove casserole from the refrigerator about 30 minutes before baking. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake casserole in the preheated oven, covered, for 30 minutes. Uncover, and continue baking until center is firm and surface is lightly browned, about 25 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare blueberry sauce: Mix sugar, water, and cornstarch together in a medium saucepan; bring to a boil and cook, stirring constantly, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in blueberries, reduce heat to low, and simmer until all the blueberries burst, about 10 minutes. Stir in butter. Serve portions of casserole on plates and pour warm syrup over top.

Grease and flour an 8-inch pan. Beat butter and 1/2 cup sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until soft and fluffy; mix in vanilla and salt. Add egg yolks and beat until creamy. Combine 1 1/2 cups flour and baking powder in a bowl; add alternately with milk to creamed mixture. Toss blueberries with 1 tablespoon flour in a small bowl. Add to the batter and fold in gently. Beat egg whites in a separate bowl until soft peaks form. Add remaining 1/4 cup of sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, and beat until stiff peaks form. Fold egg whites into cake batter. Pour batter into the prepared pan. Sprinkle remaining 1 tablespoon sugar over top. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, about 50 minutes.

Meanwhile, stir pectin into water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, and boil for 1 minute. Stir boiling water into strawberries. Allow the mixture to stand for 3 minutes before pouring into clean jars or other storage containers, leaving a little space at the top to allow for expansion. Place tops on the containers, and leave out at room temperature for 24 hours. Place into freezer, and store frozen until ready to use.

Make the cookie crust: Combine flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl and set aside. Cream together butter and 3/4 cup sugar until smooth in a large bowl. Add in egg and beat well. Stir dry ingredients into the creamed mixture until just blended. Press dough into an ungreased pizza pan. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool. Prepare the filling: Beat cream cheese with remaining 1/2 cup sugar and vanilla in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Spread evenly over the top of the cooled crust. Arrange blueberries, strawberries, and banana on top of the filling, and chill.

Set aside. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease and flour one 8 inch round cake pan. In a medium bowl combine the flour, baking powder, 2 tablespoons white sugar and the salt. With a pastry blender cut in the shortening until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Make a well in the center and add the beaten egg and milk. Stir until just combined. Spread the batter into the prepared pan. Bake at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. Let cool partially in pan on wire rack. Slice partially cooled cake in half, making two layers. Place half of the strawberries on one layer and top with the other layer. Top with remaining strawberries and cover with the whipped cream.

Press onto the bottom of an ungreased 9-inch springform pan. Place in the refrigerator to chill for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Make filling: Place strawberries and cornstarch into a blender. Cover and puree until smooth. Pour strawberry sauce into a saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Boil and stir until sauce is thick and shiny, about 2 minutes. Set aside 1/3 cup strawberry sauce; cool. Cover and refrigerate remaining sauce for serving. Beat cream cheese in a mixing bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy; gradually beat in condensed milk. Mix in lemon juice and vanilla extract, then beat in eggs on low speed until just combined. Pour 1/2 of the cream cheese mixture over crust; drop 1/2 of the reserved strawberry sauce by 1/2 teaspoonfuls on cream cheese layer. Carefully spoon remaining cream cheese mixture over sauce; drop remaining strawberry sauce by 1/2 teaspoonfuls on top. Cut through the top layer only with a knife to swirl strawberry sauce. Bake in the preheated oven until the center is almost set, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Carefully run a knife around the edge of the pan to loosen; cool for 1 hour at room temperature. Refrigerate 8 hours to overnight before serving. Serve reserved strawberry sauce with cheesecake.

Beat confectioners' sugar, cream cheese, lemon juice, lemon zest, and vanilla with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Gently fold in whipped cream. Heat a lightly oiled griddle or non-stick skillet over medium heat. Pour or scoop batter onto the griddle, using approximately 2 tablespoons for each crepe. Tip and rotate the pan to spread batter as thinly as possible. Flip over when batter is set and edges begin to brown. Continue cooking until bottom begins to brown. Stack finished crepes on a plate; cover with a damp towel. Fill each crepe with 1/4 cup sliced strawberries and 1/3 cup cream cheese filling.

Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans. Beat sugar, butter, and dry strawberry gelatin together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Combine flour and baking powder in a large bowl; stir into butter mixture alternately with milk. Blend in strawberry puree and vanilla. Divide batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 25 to 30 minutes. Cool cakes on a wire rack for 10 minutes; run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack to cool completely. dotdash meredith food studios                        Total Fat 15g 20%, Saturated Fat 9g 46%, Cholesterol 90mg 30%, Sodium 233mg 10%, Total Carbohydrate 59g 22%, Dietary Fiber 1g 3%, Total Sugars 37g, Protein 5g, Vitamin C 4mg 19%, Calcium 85mg 7%, Iron 3mg 14%, Potassium 89mg 2%

Stir cranberries into the saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and simmer until cranberries have popped and sauce is chunky, about 10 minutes or longer for desired consistency. The longer you cook it, the less chunky it will be. Pour sauce into a serving dish or jars and cover until ready to use; the pectin in the cranberries will make the cranberry sauce gel as it cools.

Grease 2 cookie sheets. Beat brown sugar, white sugar, and butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until creamy. Add egg and brandy and beat until incorporated. Combine flour and baking soda in a separate bowl. Stir flour mixture into the butter mixture until just combined. Fold in cranberries and white chocolate chips. Drop batter by heaping spoonful onto the prepared cookie sheets. Bake in the preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes, switching racks halfway through; cookies will still appear slightly doughy. Remove from the oven and let cool briefly on the cookie sheets before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.

Make the cookies: Cream butter, white sugar, and brown sugar in a mixing bowl until smooth. Beat in egg until well blended. Mix in orange juice and zest. Whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl. Stir flour mixture into the butter mixture until combined. Mix in cranberries and walnuts until evenly distributed. Drop dough by rounded tablespoonfuls 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets. Bake in the preheated oven, switching racks halfway through, until edges are golden, 12 to 14 minutes. Transfer cookies to wire racks to cool completely. Meanwhile, make the glaze: Mix together confectioners' sugar, orange juice, and zest in a small bowl until smooth. Spread glaze over the tops of the cooled cookies; let stand until set.

Press mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Make sauce: Combine raspberries, water, sugar, and cornstarch in a saucepan. Bring to a boil and continue boiling until sauce is thick, about 5 minutes. Strain through a mesh strainer to remove seeds. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Make cheesecake: Melt white chocolate chips with half-and-half in a metal bowl over a pan of simmering water; stir occasionally until smooth. Mix together cream cheese and sugar in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in eggs one at a time. Blend in vanilla and melted white chocolate mixture. Pour 1/2 of the batter over crust. Spoon 3 tablespoons raspberry sauce over batter. Pour remaining cheesecake batter on top. Spoon 3 tablespoons raspberry sauce over batter. Swirl batter with the tip of a knife to create a marbled effect. Bake in the preheated oven until filling is set, 55 to 60 minutes. Cool cheesecake at room temperature, then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, 8 hours to overnight. Remove cheesecake from the pan and serve with remaining raspberry sauce.

Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl; gradually stir into egg mixture until combined. Fold in pistachios and cranberries by hand. Divide dough in half. Form each piece into a 12x2-inch log on the prepared cookie sheet. Dough may be sticky; wet hands with cool water to handle dough more easily. Bake in the preheated oven until logs are light brown, about 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool for 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Cut logs on the diagonal into 3/4-inch-thick slices. Lay cookies cut-side down on the cookie sheet. Bake cookies until dry, 8 to 10 minutes.

Slice dates in half, and open them up. Pinch off pieces of blue cheese, and place them into the center of the dates. Close the halves of the dates, and wrap a half-slice of bacon around the outside. Secure each one with a toothpick. Arrange in a baking dish or on a baking sheet with sides to catch any grease. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the bacon is crisp.

Soak for 10 to 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line an 8x8-inch baking dish with parchment paper, leaving enough paper to hang over the sides of the dish. Drain dates and transfer to a food processor. Pulse until dates are completely smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. If date paste is too thick, add hot water 1 tablespoon at a time until completely pureed. Add softened butter to the food processor and pulse to combine, about 30 seconds. Add eggs and vanilla extract and process until light and fluffy, about 1 minute. Add whole wheat flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. Pulse until mixture is just combined, about 30 seconds. Gently stir in chocolate chips by hand. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until edges just begin to set, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then remove brownies from pan by gently lifting up edges of parchment paper. Allow to cool completely on a cooling rack. Cut into 16 pieces.

Grease an 8-inch square baking dish. In a small bowl combine the dates and baking soda. Pour enough boiling water over the dates to just cover them. Cream 1/3 cup of butter with the white sugar until light. Beat in the eggs and mix well to combine. Add the flour and date mixture (including water) to the egg mixture and fold to combine. Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until a tester comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes. Let cool slightly and prepare the sauce. To Make Caramel Sauce: In a small saucepan combine the brown sugar, 1/3 cup butter, and evaporated milk. Cook over medium heat and bring to boil.

Soak the toothpicks in a bowl of water. Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. In a bowl, mix together the soy sauce and ground ginger. Place the brown sugar into a shallow bowl. Spread open a pitted date, then stuff it with a smoked almond. Wrap the date with half a bacon slice, secure it with a toothpick, dip the bundle in soy sauce mixture, and then dip it into brown sugar. Place the wrapped dates into the prepared baking dish. If desired, sprinkle a little more brown sugar over the bundles. Bake in the preheated oven until the bacon is brown and crisp, 15 to 25 minutes. Allow to cool for about 15 minutes before serving; serve warm or at room temperature.

Work clarified butter into the dry ingredients with your fingertips until thoroughly incorporated. Cover bowl and let dough rest at room temperature, 8 hours to overnight. Pour milk into a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave until just warm, about 15 seconds. Stir in sugar and yeast until dissolved. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Pour yeast mixture and orange blossom water over the dough and mix until evenly moistened. Pinch off a piece of dough and roll into a ball; it should hold its shape without cracking. Add more milk or orange blossom water if needed. Cover and let rest for 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Sprinkle some flour over the ma'amoul molds and tap out the excess. Pinch off a walnut-sized piece of dough and roll into a ball. Press your thumb into the ball to create space for the filling. Work the edges with your fingers so the sides are even and fairly thin. Drop in a piece of date paste and pinch dough over it to seal. Place cookie into the mold cavity seam-side up. Press down so that the top is flush with edges of the mold. Trim off any excess dough. Invert the mold and tap it against your work surface to release the cookie. Repeat with remaining dough and date paste, arranging cookies 1 inch apart on the baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven, 1 baking sheet at a time, until edges and bottoms are golden but tops are still mostly pale, about 15 minutes. Sift powdered sugar over the cookies while still slightly warm. Let cool completely. Store in an airtight container at room temperature.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine the dates, pecans, water, banana, egg, butter, and vanilla extract in a bowl. Whisk flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt together in a separate bowl. Add to the date mixture and stir until well combined. Drop dough by tablespoonfuls about 1 inch apart onto the prepared baking sheet and flatten lightly with the palm of your hand. Bake in the preheated oven until cookies start to brown around the edges, being careful not to over-bake, for 11 to 13 minutes. Transfer cookies immediately to a wire rack to cool.

Add pumpkin seeds, walnuts, and pecans; pulse 10 to 15 times, until chunks are desired size. Toss dates into the food processor and mix for 30 seconds. Pour rice syrup in slowly, with the processor running, until combined and starting to ball up. Transfer to a bowl and mix in chocolate chips, coconut, raisins, and sunflower seeds. Pull off dough in 25 gram sections and roll into balls. Place in a single layer on a cookie sheet; it's okay if they touch but make sure they are not stacked.

Grease one 13x9 inch baking pan. Combine the oats, flour, brown sugar, butter, salt and baking soda. Mix well. The mixture will be crumbly. In a saucepan over low heat, cook the chopped dates with the water and the white sugar until the pulp is soft and well mixed. Layer 1/2 of the oat mixture onto the bottom of the prepared pan. Top with the date mixture and then finish off with the remaining oat mixture. Press down slightly on layers to compact. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 minutes or until top crust begins to brown.

Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla. Sift the cinnamon, salt, baking soda, and flour together in a second mixing bowl. Slowly stir the flour mixture into the egg mixture until evenly blended. Divide the dough evenly into three portions and place each on a square of waxed paper. Wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, make the filling by combine the dates, pecans, water and white sugar in a saucepan set over low heat. Cook and stir until the filling has a paste-like consistency. Cool slightly. Working with one portion at a time, roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to make a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. Spread 1/3 of the filling evenly over the dough; roll up to make a log. Repeat the process with the remaining dough. Refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Lightly grease two baking sheets. Using a sharp, serrated knife, cut the rolls into 1/4 inch slices. Place the slices on prepared baking sheets. Bake in preheated oven until set and lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Cool on racks.

For best flavor, refrigerate dates and milk overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a medium loaf pan. Transfer milk and dates to food processor, add brown sugar, and process into a smooth paste. Mix in vegetable oil and vanilla extract with a few pulses. Whisk flour, baking soda, and cinnamon in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Pulse flour mixture, about 1/4 cup at a time, into the date paste until batter is smooth; do not overmix. Stir walnuts into batter with a fork and transfer to the prepared loaf pan.

Heat until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a rigid ball or until the mixture reaches 250 degrees F (120 degrees C), about 20 minutes. Immediately remove saucepan from heat and stir dates, pecans, and vanilla into the milk mixture. Thoroughly wet a piece of cheesecloth and lay out onto a flat work surface. Pour the candy mixture into the middle of the cloth and roll the cloth around it to shape into a log. Refrigerate until hard, 8 hours to overnight.

Grease cookie sheets. Grind the oats in a blender until resembling coarse flour. In a medium bowl, mash beans to a smooth paste. Stir in the white sugar, brown sugar and vanilla until well blended. Combine the ground oats, baking powder, baking soda and cinnamon; blend into the bean mixture. Stir in the dates, coconut, raisins and walnuts. Drop dough by heaping spoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheet. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden. Cool on baking sheets for 5 minutes then remove to wire racks to cool completely.

                                    Reshteh Polo (Persian Noodle Rice) Place rice in a medium bowl and cover with tepid water. Gently swish it around with your finger to activate the starches, then tip the bowl to drain water. Repeat this process until water runs clear, about 7 rinses. Cover rice with cold water, add 1/2 tablespoon salt, stir gently, and soak for 1 hour. Drain rice without rinsing. Crush saffron threads to a powder in a small mortar and pestle. Transfer to a small bowl with 2 tablespoons boiling water. Stir, cover, and set saffron water aside. Fill a 5-quart nonstick pot with 9 cups water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Add 3 tablespoons salt and stir until dissolved. Break roasted noodles into thirds and add to the boiling water with the rice. Stir once gently, and watch carefully as it cooks so water does not boil over. Taste water for salt and adjust accordingly. Cook until the first rice grain pops up to the surface. Set a timer for 4 minutes and cook, scooping off any foam from the surface, until the timer goes off. Test rice and continue to cook until tender on the outside but still firm to the bite on the inside, 6 to 8 minutes more. Drain rice and noodles in a colander and rinse quickly with lukewarm water and a spray faucet to rinse off extra starch. Taste and gently rinse again if too salty. Set aside to drain completely. Wash and dry the pot. Place the clean pot over medium heat. Add oil, 1 tablespoon saffron water, and a pinch of salt; swirl the pot until the bottom and lower sides are coated with the oil mixture. Tightly overlap potato slices in a single layer covering the bottom of the pot to create the tahdig layer. Gently scatter rice-noodle mixture over the tahdig in a pyramid shape, making sure potatoes are completely covered and moving noodles away from the sides of the pot. Gently poke the handle of a wooden spoon into the rice and noodles a few times, being careful not to hit the tahdig; this will allow steam to escape while cooking. Cover and cook until you see steam escaping from the sides of the lid and tahdig starts to set, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, combine 1/4 cup boiling water with 2 tablespoons melted butter and remaining saffron water. Lay a kitchen towel out on a heatproof surface. Test the tahdig by quickly tapping the side of the pot with a wooden spoon. When the pot sizzles, remove it from the heat. Remove the lid and place it on the kitchen towel, being careful that none of the condensation drips into the pot. Wrap the towel around the lid and secure the ends at the top by the handle so they will not hang near the heat source. Drizzle the butter mixture over the rice and cover with the towel-wrapped lid. Place a heat diffuser on a burner over low or medium-low heat and return the pot to the stove. Cook until crispy, rotating the pot a few times, about 35 minutes. Remove from the heat and place on a damp kitchen towel; let sit, uncovered, for 5 minutes so tahdig will release easily. Meanwhile, melt 3 tablespoons butter in a small pan over medium heat. Add dates, raisins, and cinnamon; sprinkle with a little salt. Cook and stir until dates are glistening and soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Gently scatter rice on a platter and remove potato tahdig pieces and serve on the side. Sprinkle raisin-date sauce over top.

Grease and flour a 9x5-inch loaf pan. In a medium bowl, combine dates and butter. Pour boiling water over top and let stand until cool. Stir cooled date mixture to break up any clumps. Add brown sugar and egg; mix until well blended. Combine flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Stir flour mixture into date mixture until just blended. Stir in walnuts. Pour batter into the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a wooden pick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 50 minutes.

Pulse on and off to start. Process about 1 minute; check to ensure mixture is sticky and moist enough to stick together. Add more coffee if needed. Continue to process until mixture becomes a chunky mass. Line a baking pan with plastic wrap. Scoop mixture into pan. Press down with a spatula until mixture is even. Place a layer of plastic wrap on the surface and smooth again with your hands. Refrigerate until cold and firm, 2 or 3 hours. Remove from the pan and unwrap. Cut into bars of your preferred size. Store in a zip top back in the refrigerator.
